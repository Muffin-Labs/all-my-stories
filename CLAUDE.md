# All My Stories — Writing Guide

## Project
Literary fiction novel. Four acts, alternating POV per act, third person limited.

## Chapter Review Criteria

Every chapter must be audited against these before considered complete:

### 1. Third Person Limited (Strict)
- POV character can only observe others' behavior, never know their thoughts
- Inferences about others must be framed as the POV character's interpretation ("he suspected," "she had to know," "he could see it on her face")
- No omniscient narration, no future knowledge the POV character doesn't have
- No stating what other characters feel, believe, remember, or decide — only what they visibly do

### 2. Visual Imagination
- Scenes need enough sensory detail to put the reader physically in the space
- Prioritize sight, sound, smell, texture — not just intellectual description
- Sergey chapters will always be cerebral, but even his POV notices physical details (he catalogs everything)
- Bodies in space: where people are relative to each other, what they're doing with their hands, how they move
- Setting should be evoked, not just named — the reader should feel the car, the yurt, the countryside

### 3. Show Not Tell
- Never tell the reader what to feel or understand — show it through action, detail, dialogue
- Abstractions need grounding: every emotional claim should be backed by something observable
- "She was sad" is telling. "She turned to the window and didn't speak for the next twenty miles" is showing.
- Character traits should be demonstrated through behavior, not stated as fact

### 4. Emotional Depth
- Every chapter needs at least one moment that hooks the reader's feelings, not just their intellect
- Emotion should arise from the situation, not from telling the reader how to feel
- The gap between what characters say and what they feel is where the emotion lives
- Humor and heartbreak should coexist — this book is funny and devastating simultaneously

### 5. Sheepey Convention
- Kathleen and Persephone never speak AS Sheepey (no first-person Sheepey voice)
- They discuss Sheepey in third person, always directed to each other or someone else
- "He thinks it's a bit rustic" not "I say, rather rustic"

### 6. Character Voice Consistency
- Each POV has a distinct internal voice (see outline/characters.md for physical reference)
- Sergey: technical, taxonomic, classifying, effortfully poetic
- Persephone: intuitive, sensory, playful, effortlessly insightful
- Damian: TBD
- Rosemary: TBD
- Eric: TBD

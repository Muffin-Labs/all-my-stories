# All My Stories — Writing Guide

## Project
Literary fiction novel. Four acts, alternating POV per act, third person limited.

## Chapter Review Criteria

Every chapter must be audited against these before considered complete:

### 1. Third Person Limited (Strict)
- POV character can only observe others' behavior, never know their thoughts
- Inferences about others must be framed as the POV character's interpretation ("he suspected," "she had to know," "he could see it on her face")
- No omniscient narration, no future knowledge the POV character doesn't have
- No stating what other characters feel, believe, remember, or decide — only what they visibly do

### 2. Visual Imagination
- Scenes need enough sensory detail to put the reader physically in the space
- Prioritize sight, sound, smell, texture — not just intellectual description
- Sergey chapters will always be cerebral, but even his POV notices physical details (he catalogs everything)
- Bodies in space: where people are relative to each other, what they're doing with their hands, how they move
- Setting should be evoked, not just named — the reader should feel the car, the yurt, the countryside

### 3. Show Not Tell
- Never tell the reader what to feel or understand — show it through action, detail, dialogue
- Abstractions need grounding: every emotional claim should be backed by something observable
- "She was sad" is telling. "She turned to the window and didn't speak for the next twenty miles" is showing.
- Character traits should be demonstrated through behavior, not stated as fact

### 4. Emotional Depth
- Every chapter needs at least one moment that hooks the reader's feelings, not just their intellect
- Emotion should arise from the situation, not from telling the reader how to feel
- The gap between what characters say and what they feel is where the emotion lives
- Humor and heartbreak should coexist — this book is funny and devastating simultaneously

### 5. Sheepey Convention
- Kathleen and Persephone never speak AS Sheepey (no first-person Sheepey voice)
- They discuss Sheepey in third person, always directed to each other or someone else
- "He thinks it's a bit rustic" not "I say, rather rustic"

### 6. Character Voice Consistency
- Each POV has a distinct internal voice (see outline/characters.md for physical reference)
- Sergey: technical, taxonomic, classifying, effortfully poetic
- Persephone: intuitive, sensory, playful, effortlessly insightful
- Damian: TBD
- Rosemary: TBD
- Eric: TBD

## Motif Pairs (Master / Emissary)

The following symbolic pairs represent the Master and Emissary throughout the book. They should be woven into every chapter — evolving, not repeating. The mural scene (Act 3, holding cell) makes the mapping explicit; before that, the motifs accumulate unconsciously.

| Symbol | Master (Right Brain) | Emissary (Left Brain) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Element | Wind | Stone |
| Color | Red | Blue |
| Character | Kathleen | Sergey |
| Attention | Gathering (open, receive) | Grasping (close, seize) |

**Wind** moves through without grabbing. It bends the grass and lets go. It arrives without being summoned. It's the mode of attention that precedes classification.

**Stone** stays. It labels, holds, endures. Stonehenge is the first stone — built to be listened to, but everyone just looks at it. Stone is the Emissary's gift (structure, permanence) and its trap (rigidity, weight).

**Red** is warmth, blood, the body, direct perception. It appears in firelight, sunsets, Persephone's curls turning copper in lantern light. It should be present before the mural names it.

**Blue** is cool, cerebral, classification. It appears in sky, water, Sergey's intellectual gaze. It should be present before the mural names it.

The pairs should never be explained in the prose. They accumulate so the reader feels the pattern before the mural confirms it. After the mural, they can be used more consciously by Persephone.

# All My Stories
## Master Outline

**Title resonance:**
- God's message: "I wish I could start at the beginning and tell you all my stories"
- The influencer life: Instagram is literally "all her stories" — Stories as a feature, her narrative, her content
- Instagram is Persephone's main platform — no question
- The book's philosophy: personality is made of stories; truth lies beyond them
- The reader's journey: the book itself is "all my stories" — a novel that contains wisdom
- "Science and the Cult of Personality" remains the philosophical framework within the book

---

### Opening Lines
"The truth cannot be found in words. So take this book with a grain of salt."

### The Book Within the Book
- In Act 3, Persephone writes a book called **"Science and the Cult of Personality"**
- That book contains the philosophical framework — where the philosophy gets laid out explicitly
- "All My Stories" is the novel; "Science and the Cult of Personality" is Persephone's book within it

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Personality
- Within each human is a personality that operates on narrative and story
- The personality confuses story for truth
- It floats in a "sea of narrative" with no foundation — no ground to stand on
- It doesn't know there might be something outside of story that is true
- It identifies with: its own life story, the story of what's going on in the world, stories of good and evil
- It believes all of these narratives are true

### Truth (Capital T)
- Truth can only be found through observation, not words
- Truth is found in action, not in words
- Capital T Truth underpins everything but can only be pointed to — "the finger pointing at the moon"
- No one can tell you the truth; each individual must find it through their own observation

### Science as Tool
- At its core, science is about uncovering truth through observation
- But science doesn't uncover Truth (capital T) — it builds models closer to truth than narrative alone
- Science is still made of words — it operates in the domain of models
- Science = our best tool for lowercase-t truth
- Capital T Truth remains a mystery beyond science's reach
- **True science is play.** Not a grind or series of effort. Done out of a playful spirit.
- **Every human being is a scientist.** Not just academics or researchers.
  - Everyone is an experimentalist — you try things out, you observe what happens
  - The more playful and curious you are, the more of a scientist you are
  - Kids are the best scientists
  - Science isn't lab coats and peer review — it's curiosity, play, observation
  - The book redefines "scientist" for the reader: it's the observer within you

### The Title: "Science AND the Cult of Personality"
- Not about the cult of personality *around* science
- Two fundamental modes within every human being:
  - **The Scientist** — the observer, the one who looks
  - **The Personality** — the narrator, the storyteller
- The cult of personality is the DEFAULT operating mode — for individuals and society
- Rationalism / the Enlightenment is quite new; people still don't truly apply it
- When people come together: competing narratives — dismissing, diminishing, denying
- Society has run on personality for thousands of years

### Confluence — The "Fantasy" Element
- **Genre truth:** Mild fantasy — "fantasy" only because most people don't know this is real
- Reader starts thinking Confluence is fictional, then realizes the book points at something actual

### The Liminal Space — Persephone Between Worlds
- The myth of Persephone is about existing between worlds — the surface and the underworld
- The book embodies this: Persephone is constantly in the space between
  - Between personality and truth
  - Between the Emissary's world (narrative, social consensus) and the Master's world (direct perception)
  - Between the psych ward and freedom
  - Between seeing reality and being unable to speak about it
- **The psych ward IS the liminal space** — she's learning to see truth but not speak it recklessly
- She develops the skill of **navigating with integrity:**
  - Not about influencing others or slipping truth past defenses
  - About maintaining her own integrity while not triggering alarm bells
  - Self-preservation without self-betrayal
  - Choosing words that are true to her AND don't get her locked up
  - Learned in the worst classroom: a place where being too honest gets you sedated
  - She's not lying. She's not compromising. She's surviving while staying whole.
- She carries this skill everywhere after the psych ward:
  - Talks to Démion this way — rejects his reconciliation outright, but in language he can't weaponize
  - Navigates the public, lawyers, doctors the same way
  - Most people don't notice the truth slipping through

**Confluence** = the current of the universe. The living, breathing force of God/reality that guides you once you tap in.
- The coming together of multiple river streams — perspectives, wills, needs
- When you stop narrating and start observing, you can feel it
- Once tapped in, you simply do what needs to be done

**God uses they/them pronouns.** Not a he, not a patriarch. The living force behind all the stories.

**Confluence across traditions:**
- Christianity: "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"
- Buddhism: The Dharma; the Bodhisattva Vow ("may all beings be happy")
- Taoism: Wu Wei — effortless action aligned with the way things are
- Mystery traditions throughout history
- (More to map — Sufism, Hinduism, Indigenous traditions, etc.)

**What Confluence asks:**
- Stewardship of this planet
- Synthesizing perspectives into solutions for as many beings as possible
- Humans uniquely positioned for this work — it IS God's will
- Seems magical but is actually true
- No secret society — people who know are just living their lives

## Book Structure

**Format:** Literary fiction / mild fantasy, present day (~2030), interlaced with wisdom and pragmatic tools
**Narrative Mode:** Third person limited, alternating POV — each act pairs Persephone with a different co-narrator
**Structure:** Four acts, each defined by a relationship and what it mirrors

**Timeline:**
- Persephone born November 2002, Pensacola, Florida. Scorpio.
- Family moves to Beaverton, Oregon when she's 7 (~2009) — George gets job at Intel as a technician
- Meets Kathleen at school in Beaverton
- Summer 2019: England trip — Stonehenge, How The Light Gets In festival (age 16)
- Late 2019/early 2020: TikTok dance videos go viral (Charli D'Amelio timeline)
- March 2020: COVID lockdowns hit — fame explodes while locked down
- Fall 2021 (age 18, turning 19): Moves to St. Petersburg, Florida. George & Rosemary follow.
- 2022: Meets Démion Reyes (Tampa Bay Buccaneers, breakout season)
- Fall 2021 - March 2026: St. Pete/Tampa years (~4.5 years)
- March 2026: Démion joins LA Chargers, they move to LA — she buys Santa Monica house
- ~2026: George dies of a heart attack. Rosemary nearly dies of broken heart. George & Rosemary don't follow to LA.
- 2026-2030: LA years — brand at full power, power couple at peak
- 2030: Persephone is 26. Wedding, retreat, everything falls apart.
- Coming-of-age / Harry Potter-ish quality but grounded — not deep magic
- Story IS the book — philosophy and tools woven into narrative
- Book-within-a-book: Persephone writes "Science and the Cult of Personality" in Act 3
- Britney Spears parallel — famous woman "losing her mind" while something deeper happens

**Key Settings:**
- Pensacola, Florida — born here. George (Alabama) and Rosemary (Pensacola) roots.
- Beaverton, Oregon (suburb of Portland) — childhood from age 7. George gets Intel job. PNW summers, woods, BLM land behind home. Meets Kathleen at school.
- St. Petersburg, Florida — moves here at 17/18. Loft in a downtown tower. Where she meets Démion. (~4.5 years)
- Los Angeles / Santa Monica — moves with Démion March 2026 when he joins the Chargers. House in Santa Monica. Brand HQ.
- Joshua Tree — the wedding location. Adjacent to the retreat.
- 29 Palms / Joshua Tree — Vipassana retreat. Desert, ancient, vast.
- Desert Hot Springs — waypoint. The pariah moment.
- Ometepe Island, Nicaragua — eco village (Inan Itah). Volcanic island in Lake Nicaragua. Where she goes to disappear. Where she meets the scientist.
- San Cristóbal de las Casas, Mexico — where Persephone and Eric start their real relationship. Shared house with open courtyard.
- Oaxaca, Mexico — where the old Spanish man recognizes her; reality catches up
- Washington State — second Vipassana retreat, with Eric. The quiet enlightenment.

**Platform:** Instagram is her main platform. "All her stories" = Instagram Stories.

---

## Pragmatic Tools (Identified So Far)
- **Grasping vs. Gathering attention** — foundational attention skill
- **Nullification** — both hemispheric attentions gathered to cancel out, revealing pure awareness
- **Toggling** — holding one hemisphere constant to see through the other
- **Balancing / Tuning (name TBD)** — adjusting internal Master/Emissary balance in response to what's happening around you; not a fixed setting but constant responsive adaptation (like sailing). The external world responds to the internal shift. Needs a name that fits Persephone's voice — she's an influencer, not a scientist. May tie to her tarot/cups/wands vocabulary.
- **Navigating with Integrity (name TBD)** — the skill of speaking truthfully without triggering alarm bells; NOT about influencing or changing others, but about maintaining her own integrity while surviving in a world that will lock you up if you're too honest. Self-preservation without self-betrayal. Learned in the psych ward.
- **Ho'oponopono** — reconciliation ("I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. Thank you.")
- More TBD

## Characters

### Persephone (Protagonist)
- Born November 2002, Pensacola, Florida. **Scorpio.**
- Family moves to Beaverton, Oregon when she's 7 — George gets a job at Intel as a technician
- Meets Kathleen at school in Beaverton
- **Physical:** 5'8", mixed race — Black father, white mother
  - Perfectly golden brown skin
  - Pale green eyes
  - Curly dark brown hair with blonde highlights
  - Thin but very shapely — larger breasts, a lot of curves
  - Strikingly gorgeous — the kind of beautiful that makes people stop
- Extremely charismatic, natural personality, born leader
- Influencer — massive Instagram/TikTok following from teens onward
- Millionaire by 18; gets loft in downtown St. Pete tower
- Buys Santa Monica house at 22 when she moves to LA with Démion
- **Tarot background:** custom deck, readings for followers — engaged at narrative/aesthetic level until the retreat makes it experiential
- The cult of personality operating at full power

**Persephone's Voice & Vocabulary:**
- She is NOT a scientist or academic — she's an LA spiritual-materialist influencer
- Her vocabulary for understanding the world:
  - **Tarot** — got into it during her twenties; readings, horoscopes, custom deck
  - **Manifestation culture** — the whole LA spiritual scene
  - **Astrology / horoscopes** — part of her content and worldview
  - **McGilchrist** — filtered through Sergey's poetic explanations, not academic reading
- She'd never say "dynamic calibration" — she'd reach for cups, wands, energy, reading the room
- **This matters for the book:** the reader gets philosophy through HER filter, not an academic one
- **The tarot arc:**
  - Pre-retreat: tarot as content, aesthetic, personality-mode spirituality (playing with symbols)
  - At retreat: energetic principles become REAL (cups = gathering, wands = grasping)
  - Post-retreat: a lived vocabulary that maps onto ancient wisdom
  - She becomes BOTH: the scientist she always was (curiosity, play, experimentation) AND a more real version of the spiritual person she'd been pretending to be
  - This is the book's thesis in action: science and spirituality aren't opposed — they converge
- Tool names will emerge from writing her voice

### Kathleen — Best Friend / The Master Figure
- Best friends with Persephone since childhood
- **Physical:** 5'3", doe-eyed, round-headed, short, big booty
  - Sergey is her perfect physical match
- Loving, kind, can't compete — the "sidekick"
- Dated Sergey from age 14; told Persephone she wanted to marry him
- Betrayed when Persephone slept with and then dated Sergey for 2 years
- Friendship irreconcilable — won't answer messages. Permanent consequence.
- IS the Master in Persephone's life: faithful presence overshadowed by Emissary's shine

### Sergey — The Intellectual / The Emissary Figure
- Ukrainian — family immigrated from Ukraine when he was about 8 years old
- Fluent in English
- Poet, philosopher, musician
- Skinny, brainy — 5'6", shorter than Persephone (5'8")
  - Not Persephone's type physically — she's taller than him
  - But exactly Kathleen's type — Kathleen is 5'3"
- Drew her in with poetry and ideas; she consumed him as entertainment, not a mate
- His own parents are academics who forgot to ask how his day was
  - George treating him like a son is why he loves being around Persephone's family
- Always watching Persephone — cataloging her like a phenomenon he's trying to classify
- Confessed he only dated Kathleen to get close to Persephone
- Goes to Stanford at 18; Persephone chooses LA instead — breakup
- **By ~26-28: Associate Professor of Philosophy at University of Washington**
- Recommended *The Master and His Emissary* to Persephone
- IS the Emissary incarnate — brilliant, verbal, analytical
- **The England trip was his idea** — wanted to go to How The Light Gets In festival
- Returns in Act 3 as a character reference (emotionally loaded conversation)

### The High School English Teacher
- Saw Persephone's raw storytelling ability in high school
- Introduced her to **Kurt Vonnegut — *Cat's Cradle*** (her first/only sci-fi love)
- *Cat's Cradle* references woven throughout "All My Stories"
- Represents who saw the real gift underneath the charisma
- Returns in Act 3 as a character reference
- Name TBD

### George — Persephone's Father
- From Alabama. Southern accent. **Black man.**
- Absolutely in love with Rosemary — married who is to him the most beautiful woman in the world
- Obsessed with his wife — devoted, adoring
- Does EVERYTHING for his family: grocery shopping, laundry, all decisions
- Feels fulfilled handling everything for the two women in his life (Rosemary and Persephone)
- Treats Persephone like a princess — created the template for how she expects the world to treat her

**The Dark Side — George as the Original Cult of Personality:**
- George is deep into the cult of personality — he IS a cult leader of personality
- So charming that he defines the narrative for everyone around him
- Operates completely on narrative — no sense of objective truth
- Anything that competes with his preferred narrative is treated as a threat
- This isn't done out of malice — it's just what the personality does
- **Persephone is gaslighted from a very young age:**
  - Whenever her experience contradicts the narrative her parents (especially George) want, it's dismissed
  - Her own perception is overwritten by someone else's story
- **Core gaslighting memory — the hair braiding:**
  - Young Persephone, her mother is braiding her hair
  - She says "ouch"
  - Rosemary says: "Oh, that doesn't hurt. You're just tender headed."
  - Her experience of pain is overwritten by her mother's narrative
  - She felt something. She said so. She was told she was wrong about what she felt.
  - This bothers her for her entire life — core memory of being gaslit as a child

**Persephone's Inherited Blindness:**
- Persephone loves her dad more than anything — she thinks he's the perfect man
- She picks up from him: his charm, his way of talking people out of their experience
- She doesn't even see that it's a thing — fish swimming in water, air that we breathe
- The harm he does to her is invisible to her BECAUSE it's not the narrative
- She is shaped by him to not trust her own experience, and she has no idea
- **This is a critical theme of the book:**
  - The Cult of Personality doesn't require a villain
  - It just requires someone who believes their narrative so completely they can't hear yours
  - George loved her completely AND taught her not to trust her own perception
  - These two things are not contradictory — that's what makes it so insidious

**George's Death — Right After She Moves to LA (~2026):**
- He dies of a heart attack shortly after she moves to LA
- She's just left his orbit for the first time — moved across the country — and then he's gone
- **A failure of the healthcare system:**
  - They could have saved him if they had acted immediately
  - She never forgives them for that
- **It breaks her world for about three months — she can't do anything**
- The man who handled everything, who made the world work, who she thought was perfect — gone
- **Rosemary nearly dies the same day:**
  - Broken heart — one of those tragedies where losing someone so pivotal nearly kills the survivor
  - Persephone has to rush to the hospital in Florida
  - With her cousin **Lauria** (Gloria's daughter? — relationship TBD)
  - They have to navigate the healthcare system — which is also a shit show
  - Rosemary is on the brink of death
  - She survives, but barely
  - Rosemary was never built to exist without George — he was her operating system
- **The healthcare system failing them echoes forward:**
  - The hospital that didn't save George → the cops who showed up instead of EMTs
  - Institutions supposed to help, failing
  - A pattern Persephone will encounter again and again

**The Love That Never Goes Away:**
- Even after his death, her love for her father never fades
- Even after the retreat, after discovering the inner Scientist, after everything
- She still thinks her dad was perfect
- The gaslighting is so foundational, so woven into her love for him, she can't separate harm from devotion
- She's fish in water — she doesn't see it
- **She doesn't see what George did to her until she meets Eric**
  - And maybe not even fully then
  - Eric — who is honest about his own flaws, who tells the truth in the tantra exercise — shows her what it looks like when someone DOESN'T control the narrative
  - The contrast with George is what eventually lets her see

### Rosemary — Persephone's Mother
- From Pensacola, Florida. Southern accent. **White — blonde hair, pale skin, blue eyes.**
- Very kind, loving, always trying to do things for other people
- But logically underdeveloped — can't really handle practical things on her own
- George has been making all the decisions and handling everything, and he's glad to do it
- She's never had to think through problems because George is always there
- Follows Persephone to St. Pete with George (back near her Pensacola roots)
- **After George's death:** nearly dies of broken heart the same day — hospitalized in Florida
- **After recovery:** lives in St. Pete area
- **At the time of the wedding/retreat:**
  - Comes out to LA for the wedding — staying at Persephone's Santa Monica house
  - When Persephone disappears to the retreat without telling anyone (no phone), Rosemary is at the house panicking for 10 days
  - She's already there when Persephone gets home — no flight needed, no gap
  - Has been losing her mind, calling everyone, trying to figure out where her daughter went
  - Persephone has small windows alone (shaves head, finds note in drawer) before/around Rosemary
- The one who calls 911 wanting EMTs, getting cops instead

### Cassandra — Persephone's Agent/Manager
- Manages her sponsorships, deals, brand partnerships
- Returns in Act 3 as character reference BUT also pushes for justice/retribution
- Represents the Emissary's playbook: fight back, reclaim narrative, get justice
- Persephone has to steer away from this while keeping Cassandra as an ally

### Eric — The Scientist / Love Interest (Act 3)
- AI researcher and consultant; builds ML/AI systems
- Can work from anywhere — chose the eco village in Nicaragua for 6 weeks
- Came partly for the tantra workshop (knows nothing about tantra)
- Knows who Persephone is but never mentions it
- Sees past her personality/fame entirely — interested in her mind
- Tells her: science is play, kids are the best scientists
- His language + her experience = the synthesis she needs to write her book
- **Relationship progression:**
  - Sergey = Emissary (mind, consumed as entertainment)
  - Démion = personality at peak (mirrored her)
  - Eric = sees through observation, values play and curiosity over narrative

### Gaia — Owner of Inan Itah Eco Village
- Runs the eco village on Ometepe Island, Nicaragua
- Hosts the tantra workshop
- Details TBD

### The Triangle (Ages 14-18, ~2018-2022)
- Kathleen (Master/heart) loved Sergey (Emissary/mind)
- Sergey chose Persephone (personality/charisma) over Kathleen
- Persephone took him and kept him for 2 years — never really wanted him
- Everyone loses. The cult of personality at its most casually devastating.

### Démion Reyes — The Husband
- Half Latino, first language Spanish, Hispanic cultural background
- Name: Démion — a spelling that looks like "demon" on the page. Surname Reyes (kings). The name reads as a warning nobody heeds.
- Best NFL player ever — QB/running back, academic achievements, built a business in HS
- Perfect man on the surface; also driven by personality
- Power couple (Kelce/Swift equivalent); date ~4 years, marry
- Rapes her on wedding night; denies it while simultaneously justifying it
- Fabricates counter-narrative: she cheated at the wedding
- Destroys her reputation while she protects his career with silence

### The Yoga Teacher — Mentor
- Pudgy, nerdy, middle-aged, balding, annoying voice
- Radiates calm/centeredness Persephone wants
- Living proof that peace exists outside personality
- Recommends the Vipassana retreat
- Name and backstory TBD

### Persephone's Mom
- *(See Rosemary — full details in main character section above)*
- Already at Santa Monica house for the wedding when everything falls apart
- Tells cops the truth — inadvertently triggers arrest

---

**Why These Pairings:**
- Each co-narrator mirrors where Persephone is in her journey
- Sergey mirrors her intellect (Act 1)
- Démion mirrors her personality (Act 2)
- Rosemary mirrors her blindness (Act 3)
- Eric mirrors her awakening (Act 4)
- The co-narrators ARE the thesis — each shows a different face of the Cult of Personality
- Persephone is the constant; the mirror changes as she changes

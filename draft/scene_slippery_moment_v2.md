# The Slippery Moment — Sample Scene (Revised)

The cop was young. Younger than her, maybe. She could see the acne scars on his jaw in the streetlight and she thought, briefly, absurdly, that she knew a great dermatologist in Beverly Hills, and then she thought how strange it was that her brain was offering skincare recommendations right now.

There were five of them. Her mom had called for an ambulance but what showed up was five police officers and zero paramedics, and Persefoni understood, standing there on the sidewalk in her clothes that she'd put back on inside-out and backward because she'd dressed in a hurry when the lights appeared, that this was not a rescue. This was something else.

Her mom was talking to one of them. Telling him everything. That her daughter had been acting strange, that she was worried, that she thought something was really wrong. And Persefoni watched her mother's mouth moving and realized that her mother — who had come out for the wedding and stayed because she was terrified, who loved her more than anything in the world — was handing her to them. Not out of malice. Out of fear. Her mom didn't know she was triggering a machine. She thought she was getting her daughter help.

"Ma'am, I need you to put your hands behind your back."

She did what she thought he meant. She put her hands behind her, palms open, swinging them back like a downhill skier — arms straight, like a pendulum. She was presenting them. Here. Here are my hands. Behind my back, like you asked.

The officer's face changed. He knew who she was. She could see it — the flicker of recognition, and then the decision he made about what that recognition meant. He decided she was fucking with him. That she was being a smart-ass. That this famous girl knew exactly what she was doing and thought she was too good for handcuffs.

She had no idea she was about to be arrested. She hadn't done anything.

"Behind your back, ma'am."

She adjusted. Crossed her wrists this time, loosely, still not understanding that this was a specific position for a specific purpose — that he wasn't asking her to stand a certain way but to submit to a certain thing.

He grabbed her wrist and she jumped.

Not a decision. Not resistance. Her body just — moved. Away from his hand, the way your hand moves off a hot stove. An animal thing, a reflex that lived below thought, below the part of her that was trying very hard to cooperate.

And then they were all on her.

Five of them, swarming, and she was on the ground before she understood she was falling. Cheek near the concrete. Hands flat on the ground near her shoulders, like she was about to do a push-up. Knees against pavement. She could see the texture of the sidewalk from an inch away — every crack, every grain of embedded quartz catching the streetlight.

She was so outraged she couldn't think.

Not scared. Not yet. Just — how dare they. How dare they throw a woman to the ground who was trying to cooperate. How dare they show up instead of the ambulance her mother asked for. How dare they decide in ten seconds that she was a problem to be solved with force. She could feel the outrage in her body like heat, like something physical filling up her chest and her arms and her hands that were pressed flat against the concrete.

And she decided.

She decided she would not exist in a world where these assholes could pick her up off this ground.

It wasn't a thought, exactly. It wasn't a spell or a wish or an affirmation. It was more like a door closing. Like the moment in meditation when you stop reaching for the quiet and the quiet finds you — except this was the opposite of quiet. This was the loudest, most certain thing she'd ever felt. She was not going to be lifted. That was not the world she was in.

Reality flickered.

She could feel it more than see it — her face was inches from the concrete, she could barely see anything — but she felt the world shudder and shift the way it had on the meditation cushion, that same sense of the solid becoming negotiable, except now it was her own body that was negotiating. She was shifting through versions of this moment, sliding between parallel realities, and in every single one of them the cops could not pick her up.

"I can't get a grip on her."

The voice came from above and behind. Confused. Not angry — confused. Like a man trying to pick up a wet bar of soap.

"What the hell is going on?"

More hands. She could feel them — on her arms, on her shoulders, under her armpits. Hands everywhere. Grown men grunting, the sound people make when they're moving a couch through a doorway. And she was right there, a hundred and thirty pounds, not fighting, not resisting, not doing anything she could name, and they could not move her.

This went on for minutes. Actual minutes. Long enough for the confusion in their voices to cycle through several stages — irritation, then real bewilderment, then something close to fear, then back to irritation because fear wasn't an acceptable thing to feel on this job.

She wasn't doing this. That was what scared her. Whatever this was — Confluence, the thing from the movie, the choiceless choosing — it was happening through her, not by her. She didn't have a tarot card for this. She didn't have a framework. She was just a woman on the ground who had decided something and the world had listened.

Then she saw the path.

It appeared the way a route appears in a video game — not visual exactly, but known. She could see every movement the cops would make before they made it. Every shift in weight, every adjustment of grip. And between their movements were gaps, and the gaps formed a route, and the route led to her standing up and walking away and none of them being able to stop her. It was a matrix-like path — she could bend her way through it like water through rocks. She could feel Confluence showing her the way out, the current pulling her toward escape, and it would work. She was certain it would work.

And then she thought: what about the bullets?

What about the guns on their hips? What if she slipped through their hands and stood up and started walking and one of them — the young one, the scared one with the acne scars — what if he reached for his weapon? She was a famous woman. She was a Black woman's friend. She was — no, it didn't matter who she was. She was a person on the ground and they had guns and Confluence could show her how to slip away but Confluence had no answer for a bullet.

She let go.

She felt the decision leave her body the way breath leaves — an exhale, a release, a giving-back. The world stopped flickering. She became a hundred and thirty pounds again. And four officers who had been straining against something immovable were suddenly holding a small woman, and they pulled her up so fast her shoulder wrenched and the cuffs went on — cold, tight, final — and she thought: oh. That's what he meant. Behind my back. Like this.

She could hear her mother screaming from somewhere. Not words. Just sound. The sound a person makes when the thing they called to help their daughter becomes the thing hurting their daughter.

They put her in the back of the car. She went. Not because they made her. Because she chose to. And that was the thing none of them would ever know — that she had chosen this. That she had seen the way out and decided, with a wisdom she didn't know she had, that the way out wasn't worth the risk of what might follow. The Master had shown her the path. The Emissary had asked the right question. And for the first time in her life, they had worked together.

She sat in the back of the car and watched the streetlights slide past and felt, beneath the outrage and the pain and the cold metal on her wrists, something she wouldn't be able to name for a long time.

Gratitude.

# The Slippery Moment — Sample Scene

The cop was young. Younger than her, maybe. She could see the acne scars on his jaw in the streetlight and she thought, briefly, absurdly, that she knew a great dermatologist in Beverly Hills, and then she thought how strange it was that her brain was offering skincare recommendations while she was being arrested.

There were five of them. Her mom had called for an ambulance but what showed up was five police officers and zero paramedics, and Persefoni understood, standing there on the sidewalk in her clothes that she'd put back on inside-out and backward because she'd dressed in a hurry when the lights appeared, that this was not a rescue. This was something else.

"Ma'am, I need you to put your hands behind your back."

She did what she thought he meant. She put her hands behind her, palms open, like a kid standing at attention. Like she was presenting them for inspection. She didn't know. She'd never been arrested. She'd never even been pulled over. The closest she'd come to police interaction was a security detail at a brand event in Miami, and those men had called her ma'am too, but in a different tone entirely.

"Behind your back, ma'am."

She adjusted. Crossed her wrists this time, but loosely, still not understanding that he meant *for handcuffs*, that this was a specific physical position with a specific purpose, that he was not asking her to stand a certain way but to submit to a certain thing. She was trying. She was genuinely trying. But her body was doing something her mind hadn't caught up to yet.

He grabbed her wrist and she flinched.

Not dramatically. Not violently. Her body just — moved. The way your hand moves off a hot stove before you've decided to move it. An animal thing. A reflex that lived somewhere below thought, below narrative, below the part of her that was trying very hard to cooperate with the nice young man with the acne scars.

He grabbed her again, harder this time, and she felt something shift.

It was like the moment on the meditation cushion when the two attentions had crossed — when the world had flickered between solid and fluid and she'd felt the ground beneath her become negotiable. Except this time it wasn't the ground. It was her.

She became — she didn't have a word for it. Slippery wasn't right but it was close. Heavy wasn't right either. It was more like she had become the exact shape of herself and nothing could get purchase on that shape. Like trying to pick up mercury with your fingers. Like trying to grab water. She was right there, she wasn't moving, she wasn't resisting — but his hands couldn't hold her.

He called for the others.

She watched this happen from somewhere slightly behind her own eyes. Two more officers came. Then a third. Four grown men trying to lift a woman who weighed maybe a hundred and thirty pounds, and she was watching their faces change from professional to confused to something she'd never seen on an adult face before — a kind of animal bewilderment, the expression of a dog encountering a glass door for the first time.

They couldn't lift her.

She wasn't trying to be heavy. She wasn't doing anything. That was the terrifying part — she wasn't doing any of this. It was happening through her, not by her. The same way Confluence had moved her body during the movie with her mom, the same choiceless choosing, except now it was making her — what? Immovable? Unliftable? She didn't have a framework for it. She didn't have a tarot card for this.

One of them got her arm. Another got her other arm. A third was behind her with his hands under her armpits. They were grunting. Actually grunting, the way people grunt when they're moving furniture. And she was standing there, a hundred and thirty pounds of woman in inside-out clothes with a shaved head, not resisting, not fighting, just being somehow impossibly, inexplicably present in her body in a way that made her body into something they couldn't move.

Then it broke.

Whatever it was — Confluence, the slippery thing, the heaviness — it left the way it had arrived. Without warning, without cause, without her permission. One moment she was immovable and the next she was just a woman again and four cops had her and they were already in the motion of forcing her down and now the force they'd been using against something immovable was being applied to something that weighed a hundred and thirty pounds and she hit the sidewalk hard.

Cheek on concrete. Knee on concrete. Hands wrenched behind her — properly this time, the way they'd meant all along — and the cuffs went on and they were cold and she thought: oh. That's what he meant. Behind my back. Like this.

She could hear her mother screaming from somewhere. Not words, just sound. The sound a person makes when the thing they called to help their child becomes the thing hurting their child.

The young cop was breathing hard above her. She could see his boots from the ground. Clean boots. Recently polished. And she felt something she didn't expect to feel, something that cut through the pain in her cheek and the terror of the cuffs and the sound of her mother screaming.

She felt sorry for him.

Not in a condescending way. Not pity. Just — sorrow. He'd come here to do a job and the job had turned strange on him and he was scared too. She could feel it. The way she'd felt the tree's spiky presence, the way she'd felt the men in the holding cell shift between rational and emotional — she could feel his fear. He didn't know what had just happened. He didn't know why she'd been so hard to move. He was going to go home tonight and not tell anyone about it because who would believe him, and it was going to sit in him like a splinter, this thing he couldn't explain, and she was sorry. She was genuinely sorry that she'd been the strangest thing that had ever happened to him.

They pulled her up and put her in the car and she went.

# The Two Trees — Sample Scene

They gave her back her things in a plastic bag. Phone, wallet, one shoe. The other shoe was gone. Nobody could tell her where it went.

She walked out of the station barefoot on one side, and the concrete was cool where the shade hit it and warm in the sun and she could feel both temperatures at once, the line between them exact against her sole, and she thought that was interesting, that she could feel something that specific, and then she thought it was interesting that she thought it was interesting, and then she stopped thinking about it because the thinking was starting to stack up on itself like mirrors facing mirrors and she was learning — she was just barely learning — that the stacking was the thing to watch out for.

The street was Saturday-morning quiet. A woman jogging with a dog. A man hosing down the sidewalk outside a café. Nobody looked at her. She was just a person walking, one shoe on, one shoe off, plastic bag in hand, shaved head catching the light like something newly born or newly sick, depending.

She saw the trees before she understood what she was seeing.

Two of them. Maybe ten feet apart. Both the same species, she thought — she didn't know trees, had never learned their names, had only ever used them as backdrops for photos — but these two were clearly related. Same bark, same shape of leaf. Sisters, probably, planted the same year by the same hand.

The one on the left was covered in scars. Someone had carved initials into it years ago, and then someone else had, and someone else, until the whole trunk was a palimpsest of declarations. *J + M. FUCK YOU. 2019. BITCH.* Hearts and profanity and dates, all of it healed over and scarred and carved over again. And newer damage — someone had peeled strips of bark away in long curling wounds, and the exposed wood underneath was pale and wet-looking, like something private that shouldn't be seen.

She stood in front of it and she felt it.

Not thought it. Felt it. The way you feel a room when you walk in and everyone's just been arguing. The tree had a presence, and the presence was spiky. Defended. Like a kid in high school with a leather jacket and a shaved head and too many piercings — not because they loved metal, but because they'd been touched wrong so many times that they'd turned their outside into something that said *don't*. The punk look. The armor. And underneath the armor: the same soft wood as any tree. The same rings growing out from the center. The same quiet process of turning light into life.

It had become what people made it. Not what it was, but what they'd done to it. The personality of the tree was entirely scar tissue.

She turned to the other one.

Ten feet to the right. Same species. Same age, probably. But no one had touched it. No carvings, no peeled bark, no declarations of love or violence. It was just — there. Doing its thing. Being a tree. And it was *glowing*. That was the only word she had for it. Not literally glowing, not light coming off it, but something in the way it occupied its space. It was so fully what it was supposed to be that looking at it felt like relief. Like exhaling.

This is what a being looks like before the world gets to it, she thought. Before people carve their stories into you. Before you become your wounds. Before you need the spikes.

She looked back at the scarred tree. Then at the clean one. Back and forth, like toggling — and she realized she was toggling, using the thing she'd discovered in the holding cell, seeing first through one eye and then the other, and what she saw was:

They were the same tree.

Underneath everything. Under the scars and the glow and the armor and the peace. The same species, the same roots, probably tangled together underground. One had been touched and one hadn't. That was the only difference. And the touched one had done the only thing a tree can do — it had grown around the wound.

She thought about every person she'd ever dismissed. Every person she'd written off as difficult, aggressive, ugly, unworthy. Every person she'd scrolled past. Every face she hadn't seen. They were all the scarred tree. They were all soft wood underneath. They'd just been carved up by a world that couldn't stop carving, and they'd done the only thing a person can do — they'd grown around it.

She thought about herself. She thought about her own armor — the face, the followers, the game, the charm that could open any door. Was she the scarred tree or the clean one? Neither, she thought. She was both. She was the whole sidewalk.

She kept walking. One shoe on, one shoe off. The plastic bag swinging. The sun warm on her scalp where her hair used to be. And for the first time since the retreat, she felt something she could only describe as peace — not the buzzing, vibrating, terrifying peace of the meditation hall, but something quieter. Sadder. The peace of someone who has seen something true and knows it will cost them everything to live by it.

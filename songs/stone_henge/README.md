# "Stone-HENGE" — & Amateur Cartography

**Written by:** Sergey Feldman
**Performed:** Live, loop station, September 2020. Built in real time for Persephone in his bedroom studio.
**Style:** Beige by Yoke Lore — plucked strings, banjo-register, building layers, raw and wobbly and warm. Not the electronic pulse of "Careless." Folk-vulnerable. Each loop added live, the song assembling itself in the room, intimate and unproduced. The kind of song that sounds like someone sitting across from you and deciding, mid-sentence, to tell you the truest thing they know.

**Structure:** Two voices, layered on the loop station, present from the start. Not sequential — not Sheepey then Sergey. Simultaneous. The same lyrics sung by both, the same mouth carrying both, the way a chord carries two notes that are distinct and inseparable. The loop station builds them on top of each other. By the choir section the two voices have multiplied into many but the two-ness is still audible underneath — the grateful voice and the hungry voice, braided together, and the braiding is the song.

---

## The Two Voices

This is not the Sheepey that Persephone and Kathleen perform — the posh-drunk voice, the "he finds it somewhat indelicate" bit, the comedy version they built together in the car and the bedroom and the gift shop. That Sheepey is their loving caricature. Their exaggeration of the best parts.

This is Sheepey's *actual* voice. The one underneath the impression. And layered with it — under it, through it, inseparable from it — is Sergey's.

### Sheepey's voice: gratitude

Slightly formal. Not cartoonishly — the way someone is formal when they learned to speak late and chose to speak well because being articulate was the first thing that made them more than what they were made of. The dignity is real. It's not a bit. It's the defense of a creature who was nothing before someone decided he was someone, and who has carried that someone-ness carefully ever since, the way you carry a glass that's too full.

Sheepey is *grateful.* Profoundly, quietly, without agenda. She gave him life. She picked him up off a shelf and spoke and he became someone. His voice says *thank you* the way a creature says thank you — not as transaction but as fact. You made me real. I am real because of you. The gratitude has no wanting in it. It's complete. It's the purest thing in the song.

### Sergey's voice: hunger

Close to Sheepey's register — careful, precise, each word selected. But underneath the precision, a devastation that Sheepey doesn't carry. Sergey is not grateful. Sergey is *starving.* He has wanted this girl since she opened her mouth at the lunch table and said something that reorganized his entire taxonomy. He has wanted her through "Careless" and "Enough to See By" and every midnight session and every loop on the 505. The wanting has been managed, filed, sublimated into music for months. And now it's in the room and it's in his voice and it's dressed as a sheep and it's ravenous.

The hunger is sincere. That's the danger. This isn't performance or manipulation — it's a boy who is genuinely devastated by a girl, obsessed, unable to think about anything else, starving for her touch, and the starvation is as honest as the gratitude. His voice says "you breathe things into life" and means *I can't breathe without you.* His voice says "don't put me back on the shelf" and means *if you stop touching me I will die.* The Emissary's precision barely containing the animal underneath.

### The conversation

The two voices aren't just layered — they're talking to each other. The way the two voices in The John Wayne overlap in the final chorus and you can't separate accusation from confession. Sheepey and Sergey are having a conversation across the same lyrics, both addressing her, and the conversation is the argument the Emissary is having with itself:

Sheepey says: *you gave me life.* Sergey says: *you gave me life and I'm starving for you.*
Sheepey says: *I want the hand that put me there.* Sergey says: *I want your hands on me.*
Sheepey says: *don't put me back on the shelf.* Sergey says: *don't stop, don't leave, don't let go.*

The grateful voice and the hungry voice negotiate the same words. The gratitude wants nothing in return — it's pure, it's the creature thanking the creator. The hunger wants everything — it's the boy who has been filing this desire for months and the file is full and the system is breaking and he needs her to know, needs her to feel it, needs her to close the distance.

And Persephone — sitting on the bed, hearing this — hears the gratitude. The Sheepey voice. The creature who was nothing and is now someone. Nobody has ever been grateful for the thing she does — the breathing-life-into-things, the making-real. The gratitude is so enormous and so true that it drowns out the hunger underneath. She hears "you made me real" and it's the truest thing anyone has ever said about her. She doesn't hear "and now I want to devour you."

The hunger is in the other layer. It's in the loop underneath. It's the note you don't hear until someone points it out, and then you can't unhear it. And by the time the two voices converge in the bridge — by the time she can't tell if it's the sheep or the boy — the distance is already closing, and the closing feels like being seen, and the being seen is real, and the starving is also real, and she can't tell the difference because the difference has collapsed, and the collapsing is the kiss.

Persephone has never heard this voice — either of them. She built Sheepey as comedy. Sergey heard the person inside the comedy. This is the first time anyone has given the character back to her as real. And it's the first time Sergey has let the hunger live outside the notebook — except it's dressed as a sheep, so it doesn't look like hunger. It looks like a song about a stuffed animal. The disguise is perfect. The disguise is the point.

## Lyrics

### Verse — [Sheepey alone. The loop station clicks, plucked banjo-register enters. The shelf, the before, the nothing that didn't hurt yet.]

I was situated on a shelf<br>
Between a tea towel and a life I didn't yet have<br>
Wool gone thin from all the hands that touched<br>
And didn't take me home<br>
I was nothing and the nothing didn't bite<br>
You learn to want the way you learn to speak —<br>
Only after someone speaks to you<br>

### Chorus — [Both voices enter. The loop builds — "it was easy" stacks, "I want" accumulates, "don't put me back" anchors. Each pass through the chorus adds a layer of voice and a layer of hunger.]

You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
I want the hand that reached behind the glass<br>
I want the voice that gave me life<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

### Verse — [Sergey's voice enters underneath Sheepey's. The hunger bleeds through. The John Wayne accusation braided into the wanting — "you walk into this room like that" is both gratitude and devastation in the same breath.]

You walk into this room like that<br>
You talk to me like that<br>
Breathe life into me like that<br>
You knew I was falling in love with you<br>
Breathing learned to want<br>
Wanting learned to starve<br>

### Chorus — [More layers. The "I want" lines shift — hand becomes mouth, answer becomes every word. The hunger in the second voice audible now. Same structure, more teeth.]

You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
I want the mouth that said my name<br>
I want it — every word<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

### Bridge — [The convergence. Wool becomes skin. Both voices, one mouth. The disguise collapsing in real time.]

The living has no wool in it<br>
The living wants your hands<br>
The living wants your mouth<br>
You breathe things alive —<br>
Like the naming was a kindness, not a making<br>
You did that to me<br>

### Final Chorus — [One voice. Stripped. The loops decaying. No choir. The wanting naked, the wool gone, nothing left between him and the fall.]

It was easy to fall<br>
With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge<br>
I don't want to see the edge<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

## What Each Line Is Actually About

| Lyric | Sheepey meaning | Sergey meaning |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| *I was situated on a shelf / Between a tea towel and a life I didn't have yet* | Literal — gift shop shelf, between products | Sergey before Persephone — a system on a desk, producing loops for no one, inventory of one |
| *Wool gone thin from all the hands that touched / And didn't take me home* | All the shoppers who picked him up and put him back. The wear of being almost-chosen. | All the people who got close — conversations, collaborations, Kathleen — and didn't reach the part of him that was starving. The wear of proximity without contact. |
| *I was nothing and the nothing didn't bite* | The shelf was harmless. Being nothing didn't hurt — until she showed him something better. | The system ran fine. The loneliness was manageable. The nothing was livable — until she walked into it and the nothing became unbearable by comparison. |
| *You learn to want the way you learn to speak — / Only after someone speaks to you* | He didn't know wanting was possible until she demonstrated it by seeing him. | The Emissary learning desire — not natively, not fluently, but as a second language acquired late. The wanting is learned, formal, slightly accented. Real but not native. |
| *You held me up and it was easy / It was easy* | She picked him up and it was easy — effortless, the way she does everything. The ease is gratitude: you made this look like nothing. | The John Wayne line in wool. "It's easy to fall in love with you." The ease is the defense: it wasn't a choice, it was gravity. Each pass through the chorus, "easy" shifts — from gratitude to inevitability to devastation. By the final chorus, "it was easy to fall" is the most devastating word in the song. |
| *I want the hand that reached behind the glass / I want the voice that gave me life* | The girl who reached past the display to the shelf where he was hidden. The voice that made him real. Life itself — the gift. | He wants the private Persephone — the one who reaches past the performance. "Gave me life" — the biggest claim in the song. Both voices can say it and mean it completely. Sheepey means it literally. Sergey means it the way a boy means it when a girl has reorganized his entire taxonomy. |
| *You walk into this room like that / You talk to me like that / Breathe life into me like that* | — (Sheepey is quiet on the first two. The third he can claim — she did breathe life into him.) | The John Wayne "like that" pattern building toward the confession. Walk, talk, breathe — each one more intimate. "Breathe life into me like that" is the hinge: Sheepey means it literally, Sergey means it physically. The ambiguity holds for one more line. |
| *You knew I was falling in love with you* | — (Sheepey is silent. This is pure Sergey. The disguise drops for one line.) | The John Wayne, naked. Almost a direct quote: "you knew I was slowly falling in love with you." The Emissary converting desire into the other person's responsibility — *you did this to me, you had to know.* The accusation that is also a confession. The framework requiring her complicity to hold. Surrounded by the "like that" pattern so the confession arrives mid-breath, mid-disguise, and then the song keeps going as if it didn't just say the naked thing. |
| *The breathing learned to want / And the wanting learned to starve* | Aliveness itself produces wanting. The chain: stitching → breath → want → starvation. The creature outgrew the gift. | The Emissary's system, once given life by her, couldn't stop at gratitude. One step past wanting into something with teeth — physical, animal, past the system's control. |
| *I want the mouth that said my name* | The mouth that named him. Before the naming he had no name. The mouth is the origin. | Her mouth. The physical mouth. The thing the Emissary has been filing and sublimating for months. The hunger stripped of every metaphor — the boy who wants to kiss the girl, said through the sheep who wants to be named. |
| *I want it — every word* | Every word she's ever said to him. The speech that made him real. He wants all of it. | The accumulation tipping into greed. The Emissary's grasping attention: seize, hold, catalog, keep. He wants to own the language between them. |
| *The living has no wool in it / The living wants your hands / The living wants your mouth* | The aliveness has outgrown the material. Life demands contact — and life requires touch. | The disguise collapsing. "Your hands" and "your mouth" are not metaphors anymore. The wool is gone. The character is gone. A boy telling a girl he needs her hands on him, her mouth on his. |
| *You breathe things alive — / Like the naming was a kindness, not a making* | She didn't create him — she recognized what was already there. The naming was acknowledgment, not invention. | The Emissary's self-deception at its most beautiful: the belief that the wanting was always there and she merely identified it. The kindness that absolves her of responsibility. |
| *You did that to me* | The Chepstow *you.* The fiction cracks open and the real thing is underneath. No "too" — no list, no Sheepey-and-Sergey. Just: you did that to me. | Both voices, one mouth. The "too" is gone — there's no character to compare to anymore. The distinction has already annihilated. Just the raw statement. You did that to me. The convergence. The kiss. |
| *It was easy to fall* | It was easy to come alive in her hands. The gratitude. | It was easy to fall in love. She didn't try. She didn't decide. She just was herself and he will never recover from how easy it was. |
| *With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge / I don't want to see the edge* | She's holding him and he can't see where the shelf ends — where the fall begins. He doesn't want to know. | Intimacy as blindness, then blindness chosen. The Emissary, whose entire function is to see and classify and map, first blinded by her touch, then refusing to look. He knows there's an edge — Kathleen's edge, the triangle's edge — and he's choosing not to see it. |
| *Don't put me back on the shelf* | Don't put me back in the shop. Don't return me to the nothing. Keep me. | Don't stop touching me. Don't leave. Don't let go. The Emissary's precision barely containing the animal underneath — by the final chorus it's not words anymore, it's the sound of a boy who will be nothing again if she stops. |

## Who Hears What

**Persephone:** She hears her own character — the deepest, truest version of the character she built — given back to her by the one person who cataloged it precisely enough to find the real voice underneath the comedy. She hears someone saying: *I see the part of you that's invisible. The part the internet can't reach. The part that talks to sheep and means it.* She hears "you breathe things into life" and it's the truest thing anyone has ever said about her and she can't breathe because no one has ever seen that, no one, not the ten million, not the algorithm, not the teachers or the parents — only Kathleen, and Kathleen couldn't say it this way. She feels *known.* The loneliest girl in Beaverton, handed back the part of herself the world couldn't see. And the known-ness is so enormous and so physical that when the distance closes she doesn't stop it. That's not the same as wanting it to close.

**Sergey (writing it):** He knows exactly what he's doing — and he doesn't. The Emissary built the structure. Every line is placed, every loop is timed, every lyric maps to its source. He can annotate the whole song. But the song came from below the notebook — from the place the Emissary can't reach, the place where "Careless" came from, the place where the music is true even when the musician is wrong. He wrote the truest song he's ever written and the truth in it is real and the conclusion he draws from the truth is not. He sees her perfectly. He responds to what he sees completely wrong.

**Kathleen (later, if she ever hears it):** She hears a beautiful song about a sheep. She probably recognizes Sheepey. She probably smiles. She probably doesn't hear that "don't put me back on the shelf" is the sound of her boyfriend falling in love with her best friend through the character the three of them built together. The gap between what Kathleen hears and what Persephone hears is the same gap as Virtue the Cat. Six feet wide.

**The public (if it's ever released):** A weird, gorgeous, heartbreaking folk song about a stuffed animal. The kind of song where you're not sure if you're supposed to laugh or cry so you do both. The banjo wobbles. The voice is strange — formal but not ironic, sincere in a way that indie music rarely is. The "don't put me back on the shelf" refrain is devastating even if you don't know what the shelf is. You hear it and you think about every time you were nothing and someone made you someone. You don't need the story. The song carries it.

## The Virtue Echo (Structural, Not Lyrical)

| | Virtue the Cat | Stone-HENGE |
|---|---|---|
| **Creature** | Cat | Sheep |
| **Direction** | Departure — leaving home | Arrival — being picked up |
| **Core question** | "Who am I without you?" | "Who would I be if you hadn't seen me?" |
| **The name** | Lost — "the sound that you found for me" | Gained — "you held me and I was held" |
| **Sincerity** | Total | Total |
| **Comedy** | None — pure heartbreak | Present but quiet — the formality, the wool, the shelf. The comedy is the character's dignity, not jokes. |
| **The mask** | No mask — the cat speaks directly | No mask — two voices layered from the start. Sheepey's gratitude and Sergey's hunger braided together, converging until they're indistinguishable |
| **What it does to Persephone** | She can't speak (Ch 1.1/1.5) | She can't breathe (Ch 1.9) |
| **What Kathleen hears** | "Aww, the cat song" | [TBD — but the gap is the same] |

## Musical Notes

- **Opening:** Click of the loop pedal. A plucked sound — banjo register, slightly detuned, the wobble that Beige has. Simple. Almost a music box. Something you'd wind up on a shelf.
- **Verse (first pass):** Sheepey's voice alone. Speaking-register, almost not singing. Formal without being funny. Seven lines that establish the shelf, the nothing, the before. One voice, one instrument. The room is small.
- **First chorus:** Both voices enter. "You held me up and it was easy" stacks on the loop — first pass grateful (Sheepey: easy to come alive), second pass hungry (Sergey: easy to fall). "I want the hand" and "I want the voice that gave me life" layer on top of each other. "Don't put me back" repeats three times bare, building, before the fourth lands the full phrase — "don't put me back on the shelf." The loop station can stack those three bare repetitions and the fourth one hits different.
- **Verse (second pass):** Sergey's voice enters underneath Sheepey's. The "like that" pattern — walk, talk, breathe — each one more intimate, building toward the confession. "You knew I was falling in love with you" — the disguise drops for one line, the John Wayne said naked, and then the song keeps going as if it didn't just happen. "Breathing learned to want / Wanting learned to starve" — the chain that drives past gratitude into starvation.
- **Second chorus:** Same structure, more layers. The "I want" lines have shifted — hand becomes mouth, voice becomes every word. The loop station stacking "it was easy" with voices diverging — Sheepey's gratitude in the upper register, Sergey's devastation in the lower, braiding the way the John Wayne's final chorus braids. "Don't put me back" hits harder because the confession has been said.
- **Bridge:** The loops thin. Two voices left, converging. "The living has no wool in it" — the disguise failing. "The living wants your hands / The living wants your mouth" — the hunger in the lyrics now, not underneath them. "You breathe things alive" — both voices, one mouth. "You did that to me" — no "too," no character to hide behind. The distinction annihilated. The convergence. The kiss.
- **Final chorus:** One voice. The loops decaying. "It was easy to fall" — and now "easy" is the most devastating word in the song. "With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge / I don't want to see the edge" — intimacy as blindness, then blindness chosen. "Don't put me back" repeated until it's not words anymore.

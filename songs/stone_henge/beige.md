## Lyrics

I don't wanna see you smile<br>
I want you in the morning<br>
Before you go performing<br>
Tell me something I don't know<br>
And lead me to the place where no one ever goes<br>
Let me go under your skin<br>
Let me find the demons that drive those heavenly limbs<br>
<br>
You know you're beautiful<br>
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all<br>
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
<br>
And I think we'd survive in the wild<br>
We would eat plants and roots and dream about electric fans<br>
Baby, could you kill a man?<br>
Could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands?<br>
Baby do you think about the past?<br>
Do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this<br>
<br>
You know you're beautiful<br>
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all<br>
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
<br>
You know you're beautiful (you're beautiful)<br>
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all (want it all)<br>
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
So please don't let me fall<br>
<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>
Don't let me fall<br>

## Relevance to Stone-HENGE

Beige provides the **emotional register** for Stone-HENGE — the raw, unguarded, almost-too-much intimacy of someone saying *I want ALL of you, not just the performance.* Where Virtue the Cat provides the **structural conceit** (animal narrating with devastating sincerity), Beige provides the **heat**: the desire to go under the skin, past the surface, into the real thing.

### Key Lines and Their Mappings

| Beige | Stone-HENGE equivalent |
|-------|----------------------|
| "I don't wanna see you smile / I want you in the morning / Before you go performing" | Becomes the gift shop window metaphor: *"They put the lovely ones in front / Facing out, where the light is / But I don't want the window."* The performance is the display. He wants the hand behind the arrangement — the private girl, not the public one. |
| "Tell me something I don't know / And lead me to the place where no one ever goes" | *"Tell me something the shelf wouldn't know / Take me to the room where no one thinks to go."* Translated into Sheepey's vocabulary — the shelf as the limit of his world, the room as the place beyond it. |
| "Let me go under your skin / Let me find the demons that drive those heavenly limbs" | The Emissary's desire to catalog the interior — stated as yearning instead of analysis. In Sheepey's register: *Let me past the stitching into the stuffing.* |
| "You know you're beautiful / But that ain't half the gold" | Refracted through the gift shop: *"They put the lovely ones in front"* — beauty is the window display, the facing-outward, the thing the shop uses to sell. What he wants is the voice, the hand, the girl who talks to sheep and means it. The surface beauty acknowledged and set aside. |
| "With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults" | *"With your voice inside my mouth I cannot see the edge"* (chorus) / *"With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge"* (final chorus). Intimacy as blindness — but the blindness is to the edge of the shelf, the edge of the fall, the edge of the misread. Not faults but the drop. |
| "Baby, could you kill a man?" | *"Do you ever look at something made of wool / And wonder what it knows?"* The wild question filtered through Sheepey — not violence but the uncanny. The question of whether the inanimate feels. |
| "Do you think about the past? / Do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this" | *"Do you think about the gift shop? / Do you wonder if every stupid little thing — / The price tag and the tea towel / And the Tuesday and the rain — / Has led us to this."* Nearly direct, but grounded in Sheepey's origin story. The gift shop as the past. The tea towel as the stupid little thing. |
| "Don't let me fall" | *"Don't put me back upon the shelf."* The fall becomes a return — not falling from a height but being placed back into nothing. Inventory again. The inverse of Virtue's lament: Virtue says *I lost the sound you found for me.* Sheepey says *please don't put me back where the sound hadn't reached yet.* |

### The Tension

The song works for the novel because Beige's emotional DNA — the desire to possess all of someone, the intimacy that blinds — lives inside Stone-HENGE's gift shop vocabulary. "I cannot see the edge" is "I fail to see your faults" translated through wool and shelves, but the blindness is the same blindness. Alejandro's genuinely beautiful desire to see the real Persefoni AND the Emissary's drive to possess what it catalogs. The song is his best self and his blindest self simultaneously.

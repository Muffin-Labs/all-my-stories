# "The John Wayne" — Little Green Cars

**Artist:** Little Green Cars
**Year:** 2013
**Style:** Indie folk-rock, male-female vocal interplay, the kind of song that sounds like a conversation between two people who are both right and both wrong. Guitar-driven, building to the chorus where the two voices overlap and the overlapping is the point — you can't separate who's saying what, the accusation and the confession braided together. The melody is sweet. The lyric is a knife.

## Lyrics

It's easy to fall in love<br>
It's easy to fall in love with you<br>
It's easy to fall in love<br>
It's easy to fall in love with you<br>
<br>
You go outside dressed like that<br>
You knew what was going to happen, didn't you?<br>
You talk to me like that<br>
You knew I was slowly falling in love with you<br>
<br>
And I... ooh<br>
And I... ooh<br>
<br>
You know it's your neglect<br>
Is the reason that I'm so obsessed with you<br>
And when I asked you your name you said John Wayne<br>
And I guess it's true<br>
'Cause then you shot me down<br>
Doubled over and I hit the ground right in front of you<br>
<br>
I guess in the Wild West<br>
It's ok to shoot the pest that's annoying you<br>
<br>
And I... ooh<br>
And I... ooh<br>
<br>
It's easy to fall in love<br>
It's easy to be alone<br>
It's easy to hate yourself<br>
When all your love is inside someone else<br>
It's easy to take it all<br>
It's easy to give it to<br>
When there's more people out there to love<br>
Than people who love you<br>
<br>
And I... ohh<br>
<br>
It's easy to fall in love<br>
(It's easy to fall in love with you)<br>
The reason that I'm so obsessed<br>
(You knew what was going to happen didn't you)<br>
I guess in the Wild West<br>
(You knew I was slowly falling in love with you)<br>
<br>
It's easy to fall in love<br>
It's easy to fall in love with you<br>

## Relevance to Stone-HENGE

Where Virtue provides the source code, Beige the heat, Spine the shadow, and Groceries the ache for the ordinary — The John Wayne provides the **accusation**. The blame dressed as confession. The "it's easy to fall in love with you" that sounds like a compliment and functions as an indictment. *You did this to me. You were so yourself that I had no choice.*

This is the Emissary's argument. Alejandro's entire framework, distilled to a pop song.

### Key Lines and Their Mappings

| The John Wayne | Stone-HENGE equivalent |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "It's easy to fall in love with you" | The thesis Alejandro can't say straight. The thing the entire song is circling. "You picked me up the way you pick up everything — without deciding to." The ease is the point. She didn't try. She didn't perform. She just was herself and the being-herself was irresistible. The Emissary's framework: falling in love with her wasn't a choice, it was a conclusion. The data was clear. The ease is the defense. |
| "You go outside dressed like that / You knew what was going to happen, didn't you?" | The accusation at the heart of the misread. *You knew.* You sat on my bed and said things that reorganized my taxonomy and you *knew* what was going to happen. You cried when the song played and you *knew.* The Emissary's reading: she knew. She felt it too. It was mutual. — Except she didn't know. She went outside dressed like herself. She talked like herself. She had no idea what was happening inside his framework. The "you knew" is the Emissary projecting its own model onto her experience. |
| "You talk to me like that / You knew I was slowly falling in love with you" | The midnight sessions. The conversations where she said things that arrived at his destination before he did. The creative intimacy that felt like another kind of intimacy — to him. She talked to him like that because that's how she talks. He heard a declaration. She was having a conversation. |
| "It's your neglect is the reason that I'm so obsessed with you" | The fame dynamic inverted. Persephoni's neglect isn't personal — it's structural. She's neglecting him the way she neglects everyone: by being watched by ten million people who see her face and not her mind. The neglect is the loneliness. The loneliness is what drew him. He fell in love with the gap — the space between what the world saw and what he saw — and the gap was created by neglect, by the world's failure to see her, and his obsession fed on the failure. He needed her to be unseen so he could be the one who saw her. |
| "And when I asked you your name you said John Wayne / And I guess it's true / 'Cause then you shot me down" | The character as deflection. You asked her name and she gave you a character — not herself, a fiction. Sheepey. The princess. John Wayne. Persephoni doesn't give you her name. She gives you a character who says the things she can't say straight. And the character shoots you down — the princess at Chepstow, *you* landing like a bullet. Sheepey's silence after Kathleen disappears. The character is the weapon and the shield simultaneously. |
| "I guess in the Wild West it's ok to shoot the pest that's annoying you" | Self-deprecation as armor. The speaker calling himself a pest — annoying, disposable, deserving of being shot. In Alejandro's register: the Emissary's worst fear stated as a joke. That he's not the boy who sees her. He's the pest who won't stop looking. That his obsessive cataloging isn't love, it's surveillance. That in the Wild West of the triangle, it's acceptable to shoot the person who won't stop staring. |
| "It's easy to fall in love / It's easy to be alone" | The pivot. The two easiest things in the world, and they're the same thing. Falling in love with Persephoni is easy. Being alone is easy. Both require no effort. Both happen to you. The hard thing is the middle — being with someone, actually with them, in the grocery store, in the ordinary, in the place where the falling has ended and the landing has begun. |
| "It's easy to hate yourself / When all your love is inside someone else" | Alejandro's unnamed feeling in Ch 1.10 — the thing that lives between the categories. Not guilt, not regret. The specific discomfort of a system that achieved its objective and can't hold the result. All his love is inside Persephoni now — inside the framework he built around her, inside the model, inside the song — and the love being inside someone else means there's nothing left inside him except the system. The hating is the draft in the room with the missing wall. |
| "When there's more people out there to love / Than people who love you" | The math of the triangle. Three people. Two who love, one who's loved. Kathleen loved Alejandro. Alejandro loved Persephoni. Persephoni loved Kathleen. The arithmetic never balanced. More people out there to love than people who love you — that's everyone in this story. That's the gap. |
| "It's easy to fall in love with you" / "You knew what was going to happen didn't you" / "You knew I was slowly falling in love with you" [overlapping in final chorus] | The voices braiding together at the end — accusation and confession simultaneous, inseparable. This is the double-voice of Stone-HENGE itself: Sheepey and Alejandro, the character and the boy, the gratitude and the desire, all occupying the same mouth at the same time. You can't separate the seeing from the wanting. You can't separate "you made me real" from "you made me want you." The braid is the misread. |

### What The John Wayne Adds to Stone-HENGE

The other songs give Stone-HENGE its emotional textures — heat, shadow, ordinariness, the source code of departure. The John Wayne gives it its **self-deception**. The mechanism by which the Emissary converts its own desire into the other person's responsibility.

"It's easy to fall in love with you" is the most dangerous sentence in the novel's vocabulary. It says: *this isn't my fault. You were so yourself that falling was inevitable. The data was clear. The conclusion followed.* It's the Emissary's proof restated as a love song. And it's true — it IS easy to fall in love with Persephoni — and the truth is the thing that makes the deception work. The best lies are built on accurate premises.

Stone-HENGE says "you breathe things into life / you did that to me too" and means it with total sincerity. The John Wayne reveals the architecture underneath the sincerity: *you did this to me. You made me fall. The falling was easy. Therefore the falling was your doing.*

That's the Emissary's blind spot in a pop song. The substitution of ease for consent. The belief that because something was easy, it was mutual.

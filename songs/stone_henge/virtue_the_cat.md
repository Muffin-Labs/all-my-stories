# "Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure" — The Weakerthans

**Artist:** The Weakerthans
**Year:** 2007
**Style:** Indie rock, spare and devastating. Acoustic guitar grounding a vocal that tells the story straight — no metaphor for the metaphor, no winking. The cat is a cat. The cat is also everything. The production stays out of the way. The song builds through accumulation of specific detail — kibble, empties, matted fur, pigeons — until the final lines land like a door closing. The repetition of "the sound that you found for me" shifts from memory to loss to forgetting across three iterations, each one quieter than the last.

## Lyrics

It had something to do with the rain<br>
Leaching loamy dirt<br>
And the way the back lane came alive<br>
Half moon whispered, "Go"<br>
<br>
For a while I heard you<br>
Missing steps in the street<br>
And your anger pleading<br>
In an uncertain key<br>
Singing the sound that you found for me<br>
<br>
When the winter took the tips of my ears<br>
Found this noisy home<br>
Full of pigeons and places to hide<br>
And when the voices die<br>
I emerged to watch abandoned machines<br>
Waiting for their men to return<br>
<br>
I remember the way<br>
I would wait for you<br>
To arrive with kibble<br>
And a box full of beer<br>
How I'd scratch the empties<br>
Desperate to hear<br>
You make the sound that you found for me<br>
<br>
After scrapping with the ferals and the tabby<br>
Let you brush my matted fur<br>
How I'd knead into your chest while you were sleeping<br>
Shallow breathing made me purr<br>
<br>
But I can't remember the sound that you found for me<br>
I can't remember the sound that you found for me<br>
I can't remember the sound<br>

## Relevance to Stone-HENGE

This is the origin. The structural DNA. The song that split the triangle open in Ch 1.1/1.5 — Persephone couldn't speak, Kathleen thought it was cute, the gap between what they heard was six feet wide. Stone-HENGE is the inverse of this song. Everything in Stone-HENGE is a response to Virtue, whether Alejandro knows it or not.

### The Inversion

| | Virtue the Cat | Stone-HENGE |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction** | Departure — leaving home, losing the name | Arrival — being picked up, gaining the name |
| **The sound** | Lost — "I can't remember the sound that you found for me" | Given — "you held me and I was held" |
| **The creature** | A cat who had a home and left | A sheep who had no home and was taken into one |
| **Agency** | Virtue chose to leave — the half moon whispered "go" | Sheepey was chosen — "you picked me up the way you pick up everything, without deciding to" |
| **The ending** | Forgetting — the sound fades, the name is lost | Pleading — "don't put me back upon the shelf," the terror of losing the name |
| **Who can't speak** | Persephone (Ch 1.5 — she hears Virtue and can't speak) | Persephone (Ch 1.9 — she hears Stone-HENGE and can't breathe) |
| **Who misses it** | Kathleen ("aww, the cat song") | Kathleen (if she ever hears it — the gap is the same) |

### Key Lines and Their Mappings

| Virtue | Stone-HENGE equivalent |
|--------|----------------------|
| "It had something to do with the rain / Leaching loamy dirt / And the way the back lane came alive / Half moon whispered, 'Go'" | The departure that can't be fully explained — something environmental, something in the air, something that whispered *go* and was obeyed. In Stone-HENGE's world: the lockdown, the blue light, the midnight sessions, the song that closed the distance. Something whispered *go* and nobody held still. The epigraph of Ch 1.10 quotes this exact passage. |
| "For a while I heard you / Missing steps in the street / And your anger pleading / In an uncertain key" | Kathleen's texts. Alejandro's FaceTime calls ringing into silence. The missing steps — the person searching for the person who left. The anger pleading in an uncertain key — Alejandro doesn't plead, he texts *Hey* and *Can we talk?*, the Emissary's version of anger in an uncertain key. The uncertainty is the thing. He doesn't know what key to use because the system doesn't have a category for this. |
| "Singing the sound that you found for me" | The name. The identity someone else gave you. For Virtue: the name the owner called her. For Sheepey: the voice Persephone gave him — the name, the backstory, the dignity, the self. For Alejandro: the thing Persephone gave him without knowing — the sense that his music mattered, that his seeing was a gift, that the Emissary's precision could serve something larger than itself. Stone-HENGE is Alejandro singing the sound that Persephone found for him. |
| "I remember the way I would wait for you / To arrive with kibble and a box full of beer" | The specificity of the domestic. The ordinary love — not grand, not metaphorical. Kibble and beer. Groceries. The mundane as the sacred. In Stone-HENGE's world: the midnight sessions, the loop station, the bed against the wall, the position she always took. The ritual. The ordinary that was the relationship before the song broke it open. |
| "How I'd scratch the empties / Desperate to hear / You make the sound that you found for me" | Desperate. The word lands. The scratching at empties — making noise to provoke the response, to hear the name again. In Stone-HENGE: "don't put me back upon the shelf" is the same desperation filtered through dignity. Sheepey scratching at the glass of his stitched eyes, desperate to hear the voice that made him someone. |
| "After scrapping with the ferals and the tabby / Let you brush my matted fur / How I'd knead into your chest while you were sleeping" | The vulnerability after the fight. Letting someone tend to you. The kneading — the involuntary physical expression of comfort, the body saying what the mouth can't. In Stone-HENGE: Persephone on the bed, cross-legged, back against the wall. The position of someone who has let her guard down in this room. The body comfortable in the space even when the person isn't. |
| "But I can't remember the sound that you found for me" | The devastation. The name is gone. The identity someone gave you — lost, not through violence but through distance and time and the slow erosion of being away from the person who made you real. Stone-HENGE's entire existence is a response to this line. The song is Alejandro saying: *I remember. I remember the sound. I cataloged it. I can give it back to you.* And he can. And he does. And the giving-back is the most generous and most destructive thing he's ever done. |
| "I can't remember the sound" | The final line — truncated, incomplete, the sentence losing its own ending the way the cat lost the name. The sound disappearing mid-sentence. In Stone-HENGE: the loops building to a choir and then dropping to one voice and then the voice alone saying "don't put me back" — the same diminishment, the same erosion, except Stone-HENGE is fighting the erosion while Virtue has already lost. |

### What Virtue Adds to Stone-HENGE

Virtue is the **source code**. Every other inspiration song refracts through it.

- **Beige's** "I want it all" is the desire to never lose the sound — to hold it so close you can't see the edge.
- **Spine's** "I'll trade being your spine with another one" is the departure restated — Virtue left; Kathleen left; the spine was traded.
- **Groceries'** "I just wanna get groceries" is the kibble and the box of beer — the ordinary that was the real love, the domestic that the departure destroyed.

Stone-HENGE inverts every element of Virtue. Where Virtue departs, Sheepey arrives. Where Virtue forgets, Sheepey pleads to be remembered. Where Virtue's sound fades, Sheepey's sound is being given for the first time. The inversion is total.

But the inversion contains its own tragedy: **you can't invert a departure without someone else departing.** Sheepey's arrival requires Virtue's absence. The sound that Alejandro finds for Sheepey — the name, the voice, the song — is built in the space that Kathleen's departure created. The gift shop had three people in it. The song has two. The third is the silence between the loops, the four bars of nothing, the gap where an exclamation mark used to be.

Stone-HENGE answers Virtue the Cat. But the answer is built on the same loss the question was about.

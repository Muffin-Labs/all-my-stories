# Stone-HENGE — Lyrics

## Verse 1

I was situated on a shelf<br>
Between a tea towel and a life I didn't yet have<br>
Wool gone thin from all the hands that touched<br>
And didn't take me home<br>
I was nothing and the nothing didn't bite<br>
You learn to want the way you learn to speak —<br>
Only after someone speaks to you<br>

## Chorus

You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
I want the hand that reached behind the glass<br>
I want the voice that gave me life<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

## Verse 2

You walk into this room like that<br>
You talk to me like that<br>
Breathe life into me like that<br>
You knew I was falling in love with you<br>
Breathing learned to want<br>
Wanting learned to starve<br>

## Chorus

You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
I want the mouth that said my name<br>
I want it — every word<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

## Bridge

The living has no wool in it<br>
The living wants your hands<br>
The living wants your mouth<br>
You breathe things alive —<br>
Like the naming was a kindness, not a making<br>
You did that to me<br>

## Final Chorus

It was easy to fall<br>
With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge<br>
I don't want to see the edge<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back on the shelf<br>

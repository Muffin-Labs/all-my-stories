# Stone-HENGE — Style Reference for Suno

## Style Prompt (under 1000 characters)

Intimate, romantic solo live looping. One voice building into many. Sparse banjo picking, breathy male vocals close to the mic — tender, aching, like a whispered confession. Each section loops and layers, one performer stacking vocal harmonics in real time, building a one-man choir. Cumulative build, not sudden. Warm production, not polished — breath sounds, loop pedal clicks, finger rattle on strings. You can hear the room, the closeness, the wanting. 110 BPM. Romantic indie folk-pop through electronic looping. Earnest, vulnerable, longing, building toward desperate devotion. A love song disguised as a lullaby. One person trying to be enough.

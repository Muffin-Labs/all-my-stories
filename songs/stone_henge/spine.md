# "Spine" — Page France

**Artist:** Page France
**Style:** Indie folk, fragile and strange, the kind of song that sounds like it was recorded in a room where the walls were too thin. Acoustic guitar, voice that wobbles between singing and speaking, building to the "you will come home" refrain that repeats until it stops being a statement and becomes a prayer.

## Lyrics

You were my beliefs all rusting over<br>
And I was the support within your spine<br>
We noticed that the stars were all exploding<br>
So we stared into the sky till we were blind<br>
Then cut off both our arms and reached for nothing<br>
And rewound the frames that twisted in our minds<br>
And we watched their separate lives in backwards motion<br>
So we ended up connected at the sides<br>
<br>
And I wondered if the sky was just a ceiling<br>
And you wondered if the ground was just a floor<br>
Oh, how the world will make a fool of a believer<br>
I was a believer once before<br>
<br>
You will come home<br>
You will come home<br>
You will come home<br>
You will come home<br>
(x many)<br>
<br>
But the airwaves in our stomachs never seem to find it funny<br>
As we float above the ocean<br>
While I loved you from a corner through the bridge and through the borders<br>
Without motions<br>
<br>
So we'll place all our remains within a freezer<br>
And believe that they won't spoil<br>
And I'll trade being your spine with another one<br>
Who thinks that he can keep your bones alive<br>
And I'll watch him till he finds that I'm your home<br>
<br>
You will come home<br>

## Relevance to Stone-HENGE

Where Beige provides the **emotional register** (raw intimacy, the desire to go under the skin), Spine provides the **structural grief** — the architecture of being someone's support system and being replaced. Spine is the song playing underneath the song. It's the thing Stone-HENGE doesn't know it's about.

### Key Lines and Their Mappings

| Spine | Stone-HENGE equivalent |
|-------|----------------------|
| "I was disappoint within your spine" | Kathleen was the spine — the structural support inside the relationship, inside Sheepey, inside everything. The straight man. The one who held the phone. The bones that kept the body upright. Stone-HENGE doesn't know it's built on top of a spine it can't see. |
| "We stared into the sky till we were blind" | Lockdown. Screens as sky. Staring at screens until the screens replaced the world. Alejandro and Persephone staring at the blue light of the monitors until the blue was all they could see. Blindness through attention — the Emissary's mode. |
| "Cut off both our arms and reached for nothing" | Kathleen's texts going unanswered. Alejandro's FaceTime ringing into silence. The reaching after the loss — arms extended toward a phone that gives nothing back. Digital reaching. The arms cut off at the screen. |
| "We watched their separate lives in backwards motion / So we ended up connected at the sides" | The triangle. Three people whose separate lives, rewound, always lead back to the same connection. The car, the gift shop, the stones. Connected at the sides — shoulder to shoulder in the back seat, side by side at Stonehenge, the geometry that can't be undone even after it breaks. |
| "I wondered if the sky was just a ceiling / And you wondered if the ground was just a floor" | Lockdown as metaphysics. The world contracted to rooms. Persephone's bedroom ceiling. Alejandro's studio ceiling. The sky becoming a ceiling for a generation sealed indoors. The ground becoming a floor — not earth, not field, not the grass at Stonehenge, just the flat surface of a room you can't leave. |
| "How the world will make a fool of a believer / I was a believer once before" | Alejandro believed. The Emissary believed its own framework — *she chose me, it was mutual, it was building for a long time.* The world made a fool of him. He was a believer once before. But also: Kathleen believed. Believed in the exclamation marks, the playlist with twelve listeners, the boy who was a genius. She was a believer once before. |
| "You will come home" | The refrain cuts multiple ways. Kathleen waiting for Persephone to come home — to come back, to answer, to be the girl she was before. Persephone hoping Kathleen will come home — will forgive, will return, will open the door that became a wall. And underneath both: home as the thing the novel is about. ADR 0003: *You are never lost. You are home.* The refrain is a promise or a prayer or a lie, depending on who's singing it. |
| "I loved you from a corner through the bridge and through the borders / Without motions" | Loving without moving. Kathleen loved Alejandro from the corner of the triangle — through the bridge of "Stone-HENGE," through the borders of lockdown, without motions. Still. The way Persephone was still in the yurt. Loving from a corner is loving from the place where you can see everything and touch nothing. |
| "We'll place all our remains within a freezer / And believe that they won't spoil" | The Instagram post frozen in time — "the view from here." Kathleen's last post, preserved, the remains placed in the freezer of the internet where nothing spoils and nothing lives. The exclamation marks frozen. The relationship frozen at the moment of its ending. |
| "I'll trade being your spine with another one / Who thinks that he can keep your bones alive" | **The line that maps most precisely.** Kathleen was Persephone's spine — the straight man, the other voice in the duet, the person who kept her bones upright. Now Alejandro thinks he can be that. He thinks the creative partnership, the loop station, the framework can keep Persephone's bones alive the way Kathleen's friendship did. He thinks he can be the spine. He can't. He's the Emissary — he can build the skeleton, label every bone, construct a perfect model of the support system. But the spine was made of something he doesn't have: the girl who said "do it again" without needing to know why. |
| "And I'll watch him till he finds that I'm your home" | Kathleen watching — from across town, from behind the wall, from the silence. Watching Alejandro try to be the thing she was. Knowing, with the certainty of someone who held the phone for three years, that she's the home. Not him. Not the studio. Not the blue light. Her. The bedroom with the fairy lights. The girl who said "that's amazing, babe" and meant it every single time. She'll watch him discover this. She won't be there when he does. |

### What Spine Adds to Stone-HENGE

Beige gives Stone-HENGE its heat — the desire, the "I want it all," the reaching toward.

Spine gives Stone-HENGE its **shadow** — the thing the song is built on top of and can't see. Every line Alejandro writes for Sheepey about being given life, about the hand that picked him up, about the voice that gave the wool a name — all of that was Kathleen's first. She was the first audience. She was the straight man that made Sheepey a conversation instead of a monologue. She was the spine.

Stone-HENGE is a love song built on top of a spine it doesn't acknowledge. The "don't put me back upon the shelf" refrain is Alejandro asking Persephone not to let him go. But the shelf Sheepey came from — the gift shop, the car, the back seat — that was a three-person space. You can't sing about the shelf without singing about everyone who was there when you left it.

"You will come home" is the thing Stone-HENGE can't say. It's the refrain that lives underneath the refrain. Kathleen's song. The song that isn't being sung.

# "Groceries" — Mallrat

**Artist:** Mallrat
**Year:** 2018
**Style:** Bedroom pop, young and sweet and small. The production is light — synths that shimmer, a beat that bounces without insisting. The vocal is conversational, almost muttered, the register of a girl talking to herself about a feeling she can't make behave. The song sounds like being sixteen and wanting something so ordinary it's radical.

## Lyrics

Real sorry about your broken heart<br>
I'm trying to walk on broken glass<br>
Do it all again for art<br>
Like had to write a song about it<br>
<br>
I'll go if you go, if you're cool with that<br>
I'll go if you go, I have hope that you know that<br>
I'll go if you go, if you're cool with that<br>
I'll go if you go, I have hope that you know that<br>
<br>
I just wanna get groceries<br>
I'll pray you wanna get close to me<br>
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time<br>
But I think we're supposed to be<br>
And if you wanna get groceries<br>
And if you wanna get close to me<br>
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign<br>
I think that we're supposed to be<br>
<br>
I wish that I could let it pass<br>
I don't mind that you put it last<br>
I made it worse, I put you first<br>
We're laughing like it didn't hurt<br>
<br>
I'll go if you go, if you're cool with that<br>
I'll go if you go, I have hope that you know that<br>
I'll go if you go, if you're cool with that<br>
I'll go if you go, I have hope that you know that<br>
<br>
I just wanna get groceries<br>
I'll pray you wanna get close to me<br>
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time<br>
But I think we're supposed to be<br>
And if you wanna get groceries<br>
And if you wanna get close to me<br>
Just gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign<br>
I think that we're supposed to be<br>
<br>
This sucks, I'm lovesick, too important to rush this<br>
I'd miss our kiss if it ever left my lips<br>
No one I know is sticky on my mind when I go<br>
Except ya, but you're just friends with Miss Independent<br>
<br>
And this sucks, I'm lovesick, too important to rush this<br>
I'd miss our kiss if it ever left my lips<br>
No one I know is sticky on my mind when I go<br>
Heart broke, but I spend it, 'cause I'm Miss Independent<br>
<br>
I just wanna get groceries<br>
I'll pray you wanna get close to me<br>
I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time<br>
But I think we're supposed to be<br>

## Relevance to Stone-HENGE

Where Beige provides the **heat** and Spine provides the **shadow**, Groceries provides the **smallness** — the ordinary, domestic, mundane register of wanting. The radical modesty of desire. Not "let me go under your skin." Not "I'll trade being your spine." Just: I want to go to the store with you. I want the most boring version of us. That's the version I'm praying for.

### Key Lines and Their Mappings

| Groceries | Stone-HENGE equivalent |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "I just wanna get groceries" | The inverse of "don't put me back upon the shelf." The shelf is retail — inventory, display, the commercial space where things are for sale. Groceries is the domestic space — things taken home, used, lived with. Sheepey doesn't want the shelf. He wants to be taken home. Taken into the ordinary life. The grocery store is the anti-gift-shop: not where you acquire things but where you sustain them. |
| "I'll go if you go" | The conditional intimacy at the heart of the triangle. Everyone waiting for someone else to move first. Persephoni held still in the yurt — *I'll go if you go, but you went first and I stayed.* In Stone-HENGE, Alejandro goes first: he plays the song, he leans in, he crosses the distance. But "I'll go if you go" is also what he believes Persephoni is saying with her tears, her stillness, her open body. He reads her overwhelm as *I'll go if you go.* She wasn't going anywhere. She was being arrived at. |
| "I think we're supposed to be" | The Emissary's certainty. The deterministic framework — every stupid little thing has led us to this. "Do you wonder if every stupid little thing — the price tag and the tea towel and the Tuesday and the rain — has led us to this." Alejandro believes they're supposed to be. The framework requires it. The data supports it. The conclusion follows. |
| "Real sorry about your broken heart / I'm trying to walk on broken glass / Do it all again for art / Like had to write a song about it" | Stone-HENGE itself. Alejandro writing a song about the thing that's breaking the triangle. Doing it all again for art — turning the intimate into the performed, the private into the produced. "Had to write a song about it" is what the Emissary does: processes feeling into output. The broken glass is what he's walking on — Kathleen's heart, Persephoni's confusion, his own desire — and the walking is the song. |
| "I made it worse, I put you first" | Persephoni in the yurt. She put Kathleen first — held still, didn't breathe, protected her — and it made it worse. The protection was damage. The selflessness was a form of erasure. In Stone-HENGE's world: Alejandro puts Persephoni first (the song is *for* her, the seeing is *of* her) and the putting-first is the thing that breaks Kathleen. Putting someone first always puts someone else last. |
| "We're laughing like it didn't hurt" | Sheepey. The entire Sheepey conceit — comedy that covers hurt. The drunk sheep who'd rather die than admit he has feelings. "We're laughing like it didn't hurt" is the mode of every Sheepey bit: the posh complaints about modernity, the opinions about grass quality, the dignified refusal to acknowledge the devastation underneath. Stone-HENGE is the moment the laughter cracks and the hurt comes through. |
| "This sucks, I'm lovesick, too important to rush this" | The honest, unguarded, teenage register — the thing Sheepey's formality is translating. Sheepey would never say "this sucks." But the feeling underneath Sheepey's dignity IS "this sucks." The gap between "I was situated on a shelf between a tea towel and a life I didn't have yet" and "this sucks, I'm lovesick" is the gap between the character and the person. Same feeling. Different mouth. |
| "You're just friends with Miss Independent" | Persephoni. The girl who doesn't need anyone — the independent one, the self-sufficient one, the one with ten million followers who can handle anything. Except she can't. The independence is the loneliness. Miss Independent is the performance. The girl who just wants to get groceries is the person underneath. |
| "Gimme some, gimme some, gimme some sign" | What Alejandro is asking for in Stone-HENGE — a sign. Confirmation. The data point that says *this is mutual.* He sees her tears as the sign. Her stillness as the sign. Her body opening as the sign. He's been asking for a sign and he reads everything as one. The Emissary finding confirmation everywhere because the framework requires confirmation to hold. |
| "I'll give it some, give it some, give it some time" | What nobody gives anyone. Alejandro doesn't give it time — he tells Kathleen the same day. Kathleen doesn't give it time — she shuts the door immediately and completely. Persephoni doesn't give it time — she's in his bed now, the revised model, before anyone has processed what the revision cost. The patience in the lyric is the thing the novel doesn't have. Everyone rushes. Everyone breaks. |

### What Groceries Adds to Stone-HENGE

Beige gives Stone-HENGE its heat. Spine gives it its shadow. Groceries gives it its **ache for the ordinary** — the thing underneath all the metaphor and wool and gift shop imagery. Sheepey doesn't want to be a character in a song. He wants to be taken home. He wants the mundane. He wants to be the sheep on someone's bed, not the sheep on the shelf, and the difference between those two locations is the difference between being displayed and being lived with.

"I just wanna get groceries" is what "don't put me back upon the shelf" sounds like when you strip away the formality. The shelf is where things wait to be bought. The grocery store is where you go with someone you already have. Sheepey wants to already be had. Alejandro wants to already be chosen. The whole song is asking to skip to the part where it's ordinary — where the wanting is over and the having has begun.

The tragedy is that Alejandro gets the groceries. He gets the ordinary. Persephoni is in his bed, in his studio, in his life. And the ordinary isn't what he thought it would be, because the girl getting groceries with him is carrying a weight he can't see, and the weight is shaped like the girl who used to get groceries with her before he arrived.

# "Careless" — & Amateur Cartography

**Written by:** Alejandro Rodriguez
**Released:** Spotify, early December 2019
**Style:** Experimental pop, Animal Collective "My Girls" structure. Hypnotic building pulse, layered loops, the beat primal underneath cerebral lyrics. The rhythm starts sparse — just a pulse and a voice — and layers accumulate through each cycle until the chorus arrives on a wave of sound that makes your chest vibrate. The kind of song where you're swaying before you know you're swaying and crying before you know you're crying.

**Structure:** Tracks "My Girls" — verse repeats to build hypnotic momentum, bridge shifts the energy, mantra section locks into one phrase like a heartbeat, chorus delivers the thesis. The whole thing cycles, each pass adding layers, getting louder, getting closer.

## Lyrics

### Verse (×4, building layers each pass)

There isn't much that I need to keep<br>
A steady hand and a map to read<br>
With the lights drawn low and the walls worn thin<br>
I only wanted to let you in<br>

### Bridge (×2)

I didn't mean to be careless<br>
Or to draw with a shaking hand<br>
But to hold what I found in the dark<br>
I would need you to understand<br>

### Mantra (×8, building)

To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>
To understand<br>

### Chorus

I don't mean to seem like I knew what was there<br>
Like I'd measured the dark<br>
I just wanted the room with the two of you near<br>
I was careless<br>

### [Cycle repeats — verse, bridge, mantra, chorus — each pass louder, more layered, more urgent]

### Final chorus (×4, the wave cresting)

I don't mean to seem like I knew what was there<br>
Like I'd measured the dark<br>
I just wanted the room with the two of you near<br>
I was careless<br>
<br>
I don't mean to seem like I knew what was there<br>
Like I'd measured the dark<br>
I just wanted the room with the two of you near<br>
I was careless<br>

## What Each Line Is Actually About

| Lyric | Surface reading | What Alejandro means |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| *A steady hand and a map to read* | A person trying to navigate | The Emissary's tools — classification, cartography. The hand that draws the wrong map. |
| *With the lights drawn low and the walls worn thin* | A room, intimacy, vulnerability | The yurt. Two lights. Canvas walls that let everything through. |
| *I only wanted to let you in* | Wanting to be open, to connect | The Master locked in the tower. The king who can't be heard. |
| *To draw with a shaking hand* | Imprecision, nervousness | His notebooks. The crossed-out lines. The maps that never match the territory. |
| *To hold what I found in the dark* | Keeping something fragile | The three of them. The thing that existed before the drawer broke. |
| *I would need you to understand* | Asking for comprehension | The Emissary's permanent plea — the belief that if he can just explain it right, the feeling will follow. It never does. |
| *Like I'd measured the dark* | As if he'd planned it | He didn't plan the yurt. He didn't plan closing his eyes. The carelessness wasn't calculated — it was the absence of calculation, the Emissary failing at the one moment it needed to succeed. |
| *The room with the two of you near* | A simple desire for closeness | The yurt. The three of them. The territory on the map. Before. |
| *I was careless* | Admission of fault | Persephone's word. From the castle. "That's not brave. That's just careless." Returned as confession. |

## Who Hears What

**The public:** A song about a guy who had something good — two people he loved, a room they shared — and lost it through carelessness. Universal. Everyone's had a version of this. The beat makes you move. The lyrics make you ache. You don't need to know the story.

**Persephone:** She hears the title and knows. *Careless.* Her word. The word she threw at him on a staircase in a ruined castle. He caught it and turned it into this — not a defense, not an excuse, an elegy. "The room with the two of you near" is the yurt. "The walls worn thin" is the canvas. "I was careless" is him saying: *you were right.* She dances to it and the dancing is her answer: *I hear you.*

**Kathleen:** She hears a beautiful sad song by the boy she loves. She probably cries. She probably says "that's beautiful, babe." She doesn't hear the yurt. She doesn't hear the castle. She doesn't hear "careless" as anything other than a word in a song. The gap between what Kathleen hears and what Persephone hears is the same gap as the Weakerthans cat song — and it's six feet wide.

**Alejandro:** He knows exactly what every line means. He classified it while writing it. He can map every lyric to its source, annotate every metaphor, explain the structure. And none of that knowledge makes the song less true. This is the one time the Emissary's precision serves the Master — because the song works not despite the careful construction but through it. The maps are wrong, but the music is right. Amateur cartography at its best.

## Referenced Works

- [& Amateur Cartography — "Careless"](https://suno.com/s/9RbsvC4F0nD4qCme) — Alejandro's song. Persefoni dances to it in 1.07, launching his career overnight. Epigraph for 1.08. The word "careless" originates from Persefoni's accusation at the castle (1.05). Referenced throughout 1.08, 1.10.
- [& Amateur Cartography — "Stone-HENGE"](https://suno.com/s/FaA0gQX0CMl9rEAk) — Alejandro builds the song live on the loop station for Persefoni during lockdown (1.09). Sheepey's voice singing "don't put me back" — the only moment the character speaks for himself. The song that closes the distance between them. Referenced in 1.10, 1.11, 2.01.
- [Leonard Cohen — "Anthem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jzl0NlTmzY&list=RD1jzl0NlTmzY) — "There is a crack in everything / That's how the light gets in." Epigraph for 1.02. The line drives Alejandro to the How The Light Gets In festival and threads through the entire book.
- [The Weakerthans — "Aside"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17-k61p1iU8) — "Circumnavigate this body / of wonder and uncertainty / Armed with every precious failure / & Amateur Cartography." Epigraph for 1.06. The source of Alejandro's project name.
- [The Weakerthans — "Virtue the Cat Explains Her Departure"](https://superviber.com/player/EuhBQoE1Hr0) — Epigraph for 1.10. The cat who lost her name becomes a recurring motif for the gap between what Persefoni perceives and what Kathleen hears (1.05, 1.07).
- [William Blake — *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*](https://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Heaven-Hell-William-Blake/dp/0486281221) — Roger gives Persefoni the book after yin class in Tampa (2.09). "Heaven is all around you" becomes her metabolized Blake — the doors of perception, the cleansing, restraint as cowardice. The line threads from 2.09 through the wedding ceremony (2.11) and into Act 3. Huxley named *The Doors of Perception* after Blake; The Doors named their band after Huxley. The chain starts with a poet.
- [Iain McGilchrist — *The Master and His Emissary*](https://www.amazon.com/Master-His-Emissary-Divided-Western/dp/0300188374) — The philosophical spine of the book. Alejandro discovers it in a Hawthorne bookshop (1.02), hears McGilchrist speak at the festival (1.03), and filters everything through its framework. The Master/Emissary metaphor surfaces in Persefoni's own thinking by Act 2 (2.03, 2.07).

# COVID-19 Timeline — Beaverton, Oregon

> Reference doc for pandemic details as experienced by a teenager in Beaverton (Washington County, Portland metro).

## March 2020: The Shutdown

- **March 8**: Governor Kate Brown declares state of emergency.
- **March 12**: All K-12 schools closed statewide starting March 16. Initially "two weeks." They never came back that school year.
- **March 23**: "Stay Home, Save Lives" executive order. No end date. Non-essential businesses closed. Restaurants takeout only. Malls, gyms, theaters shut.

**On the ground**: Beaverton's strip malls and shopping centers (Cedar Hills Crossing) emptied out. Schools pivoted to hastily assembled online instruction — teachers emailing worksheets, early Zoom chaos.

## April–May 2020: Deep Lockdown

- Schools confirm they will not reopen for the remainder of 2019–2020. Class of 2020 gets no prom, no graduation (or a drive-through version).
- Oregon's case counts stay relatively low (early lockdown worked), but metro stays locked down.
- **May 15**: County-by-county reopening framework unveiled. Counties apply for Phase 1 based on metrics. Rural counties go first.

## June 2020: Phase 1

- **June 1**: Washington County approved for Phase 1. Restaurants reopen limited capacity (outdoor dining, reduced indoor). Gyms, salons, malls reopen with restrictions.
- **June 19**: Multnomah County enters Phase 1. The three metro counties (Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas) are linked — all must qualify together for Phase 2.
- **June 24**: Mandatory mask order for indoor public spaces in Washington County.
- Beaverton creates the **1st Street Dining Commons** — a block of SW First Street closed to cars, with firepit tables, stump chairs, and a small covered playground. One of the few social gathering spots.

## July 2020: Phase 2 Stalls / Portland Protests

- **July 1**: Statewide mask mandate — masks required in all indoor public spaces.
- Metro area was supposed to be eligible for Phase 2 around July 10. **It never happened.** Case counts rising. Portland metro stuck in Phase 1 while rural Oregon advanced.
- **George Floyd / BLM protests** in Portland since late May. By July, many nights drew 1,000+ people. Federal courthouse the epicenter.
- **Early-to-mid July**: Federal agents (DHS, CBP) arrive under Trump administration orders. Unmarked vans, unidentified officers in camo detaining protesters. "Wall of Moms." "Naked Athena." Tear gas, leaf blowers.
- **Late July**: Federal officers begin withdrawing after negotiations.

**For a teenager**: The protests were 15–20 minutes away in downtown Portland. Many teenagers went. Inescapable on social media even if you didn't. Meanwhile summer was a non-event — no camps, no summer jobs, hanging out at someone's backyard if you were lucky.

## August 2020: Back-to-School That Wasn't

- BSD announces 2020–2021 starts **fully online** (Comprehensive Distance Learning). No hybrid. No in-person. State metrics made it impossible for the metro area to qualify.

## September 2020: The Smoke Apocalypse

- **September 7–14**: Catastrophic wildfire smoke blankets the entire Willamette Valley. Multiple large fires (1.5M+ acres in OR and WA). Portland AQI hits **500+** — literally off the charts. Worst air quality of any major city in the world during this period.
- Sky turned **orange-brown, then deep eerie red**. Visibility dropped to 50 feet in places. Ash fell like snow. Burned your throat to go outside. Sun was a dim red disc or invisible.
- Can't open windows. Can't go outside. COVID lockdown + smoke lockdown. Post-apocalyptic.

**This is the most visceral detail.** A teenager sealed inside their house, sky the color of a bruise, ash on the car windshield every morning.

## October 2020: The Long Plateau

- Washington County remains in Phase 1. Online school continues. Fall sports cancelled.
- Beaverton Restaurant Week happens but it's all outdoor dining or takeout.

## November 2020: The Freeze

- Cases surge nationally and in Oregon.
- **November 18**: Brown orders statewide "freeze" — the most restrictive measures since March. Restaurants back to takeout/delivery only. Gyms, museums, indoor entertainment all close again. Social gatherings limited to **6 people max from no more than 2 households**.
- Thanksgiving with 6 people max. Gray, rainy Portland November. Three months of online school. Restaurants shuttered again. The feeling of going backwards.

## December 2020: Extreme Risk

- **December 3**: New four-tier risk framework (Extreme Risk / High Risk / Moderate Risk / Lower Risk). **Washington County placed in Extreme Risk.**
- BSD announces remote learning continues through February 8 for grades 4–12.
- **Late December**: First vaccines arrive in Oregon. Phase 1a — healthcare workers and long-term care residents. Teenagers nowhere near the front of the line.

## January 2021: Still Online

- Washington County remains at Extreme Risk through mid-January.
- **January 27**: BSD and PPS lay out plans for **April restart** of in-person instruction.
- BSD extends distance learning through February, with limited in-person (youngest students only) tentatively set for February 22.

## February 2021: Ice Storm

- **February 11–15**: Massive ice storm hits Portland metro. An inch of ice on power lines and trees. **330,000+ Oregonians lose power** — largest outage in Oregon history. Some without power for **over a week**. PGE doesn't fully restore until March 1.
- **February 22**: BSD announces middle and high school hybrid return for **April 19**.

**The accumulated weight**: COVID lockdown + online school + now no electricity and no heat in February. Trees crashing under ice, transformer explosions, the eerie sound of branches snapping all night. For many families, this was the lowest point.

## March 2021: One Year In

- Vaccines more widely available but teenagers (under 16) still not eligible.
- Washington County fluctuates between risk tiers.
- BSD starts bringing back youngest students (Pre-K through 2nd) for hybrid the week of April 5.

## April 2021: Back in the Building (Sort Of)

- **April 19**: Middle school students begin hybrid.
- **April 22**: High school students begin hybrid (first of two groups).
- **Hybrid model**: Two cohorts (A and B). Each attends **2 full days on campus, 3 days online**. Masks required all day. Six feet of distance. One-directional hallways. Class sizes halved. Teachers simultaneously addressing the room and a grid of laptop screens ("simulcast"). Not all students return — some stay fully remote.

**What it felt like**: It doesn't feel like school — it feels like school cosplay. You eat lunch socially distanced. You can't see anyone's face below the eyes. Half-empty hallways.

## May–June 2021: Light at the End

- **May 1**: All Oregon adults vaccine-eligible.
- **May 10**: Pfizer authorized for ages 12–15.
- **June 30**: Brown ends statewide mask mandate.
- School year ends. A high schooler spent ~7 months fully online and ~2 months in weird hybrid (2 days/week, masked).

## July 2021: "Normal" (Briefly)

- **July 2**: Oregon hits 70% first-dose threshold. County risk metrics dropped. Capacity limits lifted. Masks no longer required in most settings. Closest to normal since March 2020.
- Doesn't last — Delta variant surges. By August, indoor mask mandate reimposed.

## Oregon-Specific Details

- **Governor Kate Brown** was the central figure. Phased, county-by-county, metrics-based approach.
- "Phase 1 / Phase 2" language, then "Extreme Risk / High Risk / Moderate Risk / Lower Risk" tiers.
- Tri-county metro (Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas) linked as single unit for reopening — almost always in the most restrictive tier while rural Oregon reopened faster. Significant urban/rural tension.
- The 70% vaccination threshold for lifting restrictions was Brown's signature policy.

## Sensory Details for Fiction

- **Smoke week (Sep 2020)**: Orange sky, ash falling, AQI 500+, can't go outside. Apocalyptic.
- **Ice storm (Feb 2021)**: Trees crashing, transformer explosions, no power for days, ice an inch thick.
- **1st Street Dining Commons**: Firepit tables, stump chairs — one alive social space.
- **Zoom school**: Cameras off, teachers talking to black rectangles, "you're on mute."
- **Protests**: Tear gas downtown, leaf blowers, Wall of Moms, unmarked federal agents in camo.
- **November freeze**: 6-person Thanksgiving, restaurants shuttered again, going backwards.
- **Hybrid school**: Half-empty hallways, one-way traffic, lunch 6 feet apart, masked, simulcast.

## The Concept

Persefoni commissions a custom 78-card tarot deck as part of her brand. She replaces the traditional suit symbols with body-based imagery — hands, fingers, the mind, the body. She does this instinctively, aesthetically. She doesn't know she's encoding an attention framework. She just thinks hands are more beautiful than cups.

The deck launches September 2026 (LA era, chapter 2.07). Gold edges, her initials embossed on the box. Thursday night Lives on Instagram where she does readings.

## The Four Suits — Visual Redesign

### Cups — The Open Hand
- **Traditional symbol:** A chalice, a vessel that holds liquid
- **Persefoni's redesign:** An open hand, palm up, fingers relaxed
- **What it looks like on the cards:** A single hand, golden-brown skin (her skin), palm facing the sky. The hand is empty but not reaching. Receiving. The lines of the palm visible — lifeline, heartline, the personal geography of a hand that's choosing to stay open.
- **What it means in tarot:** Emotion, intuition, relationships, the inner life
- **What it secretly maps to:** Gathering attention — the open, receptive mode. Allowing things to come instead of reaching for them.
- **Her narration on Lives:** "Cups is the open hand. It's what you do when you stop reaching and just... let things arrive."

### Wands — The Grasping Hand
- **Traditional symbol:** A wooden staff or rod
- **Persefoni's redesign:** A hand closing, fingers tensed, gripping
- **What it looks like on the cards:** The same hand, same golden-brown skin — but closed. Fingers curled, knuckles visible, tendons taut. Not a fist of anger but a fist of intention. The hand that grips the wand. The same hand as cups, in a different state — one open, one closed.
- **What it means in tarot:** Energy, action, creativity, will, drive
- **What it secretly maps to:** Grasping attention — the narrowing, focusing, seizing mode. The same hand that receives can also reach and hold.
- **Her narration on Lives:** "Wands is the closed hand. Same hand as cups — but gripping. Holding on. It doesn't wait for things to arrive. It reaches."

### Swords — The Mind
- **Traditional symbol:** A blade, a weapon
- **Persefoni's redesign:** A face in profile with the top of the skull open, luminous — thought made visible
- **What it looks like on the cards:** A silhouette in profile, no specific features (not her face — universal). The crown of the head dissolves into light, rays, geometric patterns — the mind's activity made visual. Not a brain — something between a halo and an explosion. The intellect as radiance, as cutting clarity, as the thing that separates and distinguishes.
- **What it means in tarot:** Intellect, conflict, truth, communication, the double-edged nature of thought
- **What it secretly maps to:** The analytical mode. Classification, language, the blade that separates whole from part. Swords cut — they divide the world into categories. Necessary and dangerous.
- **Her narration on Lives:** "Swords is the mind doing what the mind does — cutting through everything until there's nothing left to cut."

### Pentacles — The Body
- **Traditional symbol:** A coin or disc with a five-pointed star
- **Persefoni's redesign:** A human figure, standing, grounded — the body as earth
- **What it looks like on the cards:** A figure standing with bare feet on soil. Not detailed — more like a woodcut, an outline, the body as form rather than portrait. Arms at sides. Weight evenly distributed. The posture of someone who has stopped moving and is simply here. The ground beneath the feet textured — roots, earth, stone.
- **What it means in tarot:** Material world, health, work, money, the physical, the practical
- **What it secretly maps to:** The body as instrument of direct perception. Before the mind classifies, the body knows. The body that registers temperature, danger, love, truth — the somatic knowing. Pentacles is where understanding lives before it has words.
- **Her narration on Lives:** "Pentacles is the body. Not what it looks like. What it knows."

## The Design as a System

What Persefoni doesn't consciously realize (until 3.01):

| Suit | Image | Mode | Attention |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| Cups | Open hand | Receiving | Gathering |
| Wands | Grasping hand | Directing | Grasping |
| Swords | The mind | Cutting | Analyzing |
| Pentacles | The body | Grounding | Sensing |

The four images form two pairs:
- **Cups + Pentacles** = receptive axis (open hand + grounded body = receiving, embodied)
- **Wands + Swords** = directed axis (grasping hand + luminous mind = focusing, analytical)

Note: These are attention modes, not hemisphere assignments. Either the Master or the Emissary can gather or grasp. The grasping/gathering axis is independent of the Master/Emissary axis.

She designed this intuitively. She'll understand it experientially.

## In the Prose

The deck exists as:
1. **Brand content** (2.07) — launched, sold, used on Lives
2. **Personal practice** (2.09) — she does readings for herself, knows the vocabulary
3. **Perceptual bridge** (2.09 sleepless night) — the cards start to feel like a language she's been speaking without understanding
4. **Recognition** (3.01) — sitting on the cushion, she discovers that gathering attention IS the open hand and grasping attention IS the closed hand. The cards weren't metaphors. They were descriptions.

## Aesthetic Notes

- Gold edges on every card
- Sheepey embossed on the card backs
- Color palette: warm earth tones, golds, deep reds — the red/warmth motif running through the deck
- The artist is unnamed in the prose (just "her artist")
- The backs feature a subtle pattern that could be wind or could be stone depending on how you look at it
- The box is velvet-lined, the kind of object that feels like it matters when you hold it

# All My Stories — Master Structure

**Narrative Mode:** Third person limited, alternating POV per act
**Epigraphs:** Every chapter opens with an epigraph. **Persefoni's chapters** always use quotes from "Science & the Cult of Personality" (the book-within-the-book). **Alejandro's chapters** use a mix of quotes from "Science & the Cult of Personality" and real-world sources (McGilchrist, Cohen, etc.) — the blend makes the book-within-the-book feel real by placing it alongside actual texts. **Démion's chapters** use quotes about him or things he said — the world's perception of him, or his own words.

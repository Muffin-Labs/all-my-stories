# All My Stories — Master Structure

**Narrative Mode:** Third person limited, alternating POV per act
**Epigraphs:** Every chapter opens with an epigraph — a mix of quotes from "Science & the Cult of Personality" (the book-within-the-book) and real-world sources (McGilchrist, Cohen, etc.). The blend makes "Science & the Cult of Personality" feel like a real book by placing it alongside actual texts.

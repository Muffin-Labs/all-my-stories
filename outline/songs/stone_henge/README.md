# "Stone-HENGE" — & Amateur Cartography

**Written by:** Sergey Feldman
**Performed:** Live, loop station, September 2020. Built in real time for Persephone in his bedroom studio.
**Style:** Beige by Yoke Lore — plucked strings, banjo-register, building layers, raw and wobbly and warm. Not the electronic pulse of "Careless." Folk-vulnerable. Each loop added live, the song assembling itself in the room, intimate and unproduced. The kind of song that sounds like someone sitting across from you and deciding, mid-sentence, to tell you the truest thing they know.

**Structure:** Two voices, layered on the loop station, present from the start. Not sequential — not Sheepey then Sergey. Simultaneous. The same lyrics sung by both, the same mouth carrying both, the way a chord carries two notes that are distinct and inseparable. The loop station builds them on top of each other. By the choir section the two voices have multiplied into many but the two-ness is still audible underneath — the grateful voice and the hungry voice, braided together, and the braiding is the song.

---

## The Two Voices

This is not the Sheepey that Persephone and Kathleen perform — the posh-drunk voice, the "he finds it somewhat indelicate" bit, the comedy version they built together in the car and the bedroom and the gift shop. That Sheepey is their loving caricature. Their exaggeration of the best parts.

This is Sheepey's *actual* voice. The one underneath the impression. And layered with it — under it, through it, inseparable from it — is Sergey's.

### Sheepey's voice: gratitude

Slightly formal. Not cartoonishly — the way someone is formal when they learned to speak late and chose to speak well because being articulate was the first thing that made them more than what they were made of. The dignity is real. It's not a bit. It's the defense of a creature who was nothing before someone decided he was someone, and who has carried that someone-ness carefully ever since, the way you carry a glass that's too full.

Sheepey is *grateful.* Profoundly, quietly, without agenda. She gave him life. She picked him up off a shelf and spoke and he became someone. His voice says *thank you* the way a creature says thank you — not as transaction but as fact. You made me real. I am real because of you. The gratitude has no wanting in it. It's complete. It's the purest thing in the song.

### Sergey's voice: hunger

Close to Sheepey's register — careful, precise, each word selected. But underneath the precision, a devastation that Sheepey doesn't carry. Sergey is not grateful. Sergey is *starving.* He has wanted this girl since she opened her mouth at the lunch table and said something that reorganized his entire taxonomy. He has wanted her through "Careless" and "Enough to See By" and every midnight session and every loop on the 505. The wanting has been managed, filed, sublimated into music for months. And now it's in the room and it's in his voice and it's dressed as a sheep and it's ravenous.

The hunger is sincere. That's the danger. This isn't performance or manipulation — it's a boy who is genuinely devastated by a girl, obsessed, unable to think about anything else, starving for her touch, and the starvation is as honest as the gratitude. His voice says "you breathe things into life" and means *I can't breathe without you.* His voice says "don't put me back upon the shelf" and means *if you stop touching me I will die.* The Emissary's precision barely containing the animal underneath.

### The conversation

The two voices aren't just layered — they're talking to each other. The way the two voices in The John Wayne overlap in the final chorus and you can't separate accusation from confession. Sheepey and Sergey are having a conversation across the same lyrics, both addressing her, and the conversation is the argument the Emissary is having with itself:

Sheepey says: *you gave me life.* Sergey says: *you gave me life and I'm starving for you.*
Sheepey says: *I want the hand that put me there.* Sergey says: *I want your hands on me.*
Sheepey says: *don't put me back on the shelf.* Sergey says: *don't stop, don't leave, don't let go.*

The grateful voice and the hungry voice negotiate the same words. The gratitude wants nothing in return — it's pure, it's the creature thanking the creator. The hunger wants everything — it's the boy who has been filing this desire for months and the file is full and the system is breaking and he needs her to know, needs her to feel it, needs her to close the distance.

And Persephone — sitting on the bed, hearing this — hears the gratitude. The Sheepey voice. The creature who was nothing and is now someone. Nobody has ever been grateful for the thing she does — the breathing-life-into-things, the making-real. The gratitude is so enormous and so true that it drowns out the hunger underneath. She hears "you made me real" and it's the truest thing anyone has ever said about her. She doesn't hear "and now I want to devour you."

The hunger is in the other layer. It's in the loop underneath. It's the note you don't hear until someone points it out, and then you can't unhear it. And by the time the two voices converge in verse 4 — by the time she can't tell if it's the sheep or the boy — the distance is already closing, and the closing feels like being seen, and the being seen is real, and the starving is also real, and she can't tell the difference because the difference has collapsed, and the collapsing is the kiss.

Persephone has never heard this voice — either of them. She built Sheepey as comedy. Sergey heard the person inside the comedy. This is the first time anyone has given the character back to her as real. And it's the first time Sergey has let the hunger live outside the notebook — except it's dressed as a sheep, so it doesn't look like hunger. It looks like a song about a stuffed animal. The disguise is perfect. The disguise is the point.

## Lyrics

### Verse 1 — [Sheepey's voice alone. The shelf. Before her. The loop station clicks and the first plucked sound enters — simple, wobbly, a music box on a shelf.]

I was situated on a shelf<br>
Between a tea towel and a life I didn't have yet<br>
Stitched face, price tag, wool gone thin<br>
From all the hands that touched and didn't take me home<br>
<br>
I didn't want for much<br>
I didn't want at all<br>
You learn to want the way you learn to speak —<br>
only after someone speaks to you<br>
And I was wool and thread and a stitched eye<br>
Pointed at a door I couldn't walk through<br>

### Verse 2 — [Sergey's voice enters underneath. The two voices begin to braid. "You picked me up" loops — first time grateful, second time hungry. The hunger bleeds through on "I was ruined by the looking."]

You picked me up the way you pick up everything —<br>
Without deciding to<br>
The way you walk into a room and the room rearranges<br>
The way you say a word and the word means something new<br>
You held me up and looked at me<br>
And I was looked at<br>
And I was ruined by the looking<br>
<br>
Tell me something the shelf wouldn't know<br>
Lead me to the room where no one thinks to go<br>
I was nothing before you held me up to the light<br>
I was nothing and the nothing didn't bite<br>
Until you made it not enough<br>

### Refrain — [The loopable line. This is what the loop station builds on — short enough to stack, ambiguous enough for both voices. Sheepey: it was easy to come alive in your hands. Sergey: it was easy to fall. Each pass adds a layer. Each layer adds hunger.]

It was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy to fall<br>

### Chorus — [Both voices fully present. The "I want" accumulates — each line hungrier than the last. Sheepey wants to be held. Sergey wants to consume. Same word, different teeth.]

They put the lovely ones in front<br>
Facing out, where the light is<br>
But I don't want the window<br>
I want the hand that reached behind the glass<br>
I want the voice that taught the wool to answer<br>
I want the mouth that said my name<br>
I want the girl who talks to sheep and means it<br>
Every word<br>
I want it<br>
Every word<br>
With your voice inside my mouth I cannot see the edge<br>
So please<br>
Don't put me back upon the shelf<br>
Don't put me back upon the shelf<br>

### Verse 3 — [Sheepey's voice warm, dreaming — the field, the stones. But Sergey's questions are louder now. The "you knew" is John Wayne through wool: *did you know what you were doing when you looked at me like that?*]

And I think we'd last out in the field<br>
We'd eat the grass and dream beneath the stones<br>
And forget the shop where I was born<br>
Do you think about the rain?<br>
Do you wonder if the stupid little things —<br>
The price tag and the tea towel<br>
And the Tuesday and the half moon —<br>
Led us here<br>
<br>
Do you ever hold a thing that cannot speak<br>
And hear it anyway?<br>
Do you ever look at something made of wool<br>
And feel it looking back?<br>
<br>
You knew<br>
You had to know<br>
You talk to me like that<br>
You walk into this room like that<br>
You had to know what you were doing to me<br>

### Refrain — [Returns. More layers. The loop station stacking the line on itself. The hunger audible now — "easy to fall" has shifted from gratitude to desperation. The voices diverge and overlap like the John Wayne final chorus.]

It was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
You held me up and it was easy<br>
It was easy to fall<br>
(You held me up and it was easy)<br>
It was easy to fall<br>
(It was easy)<br>
It was easy to fall<br>

### Verse 4 — [The two voices converge. The wool becomes skin. The shelf becomes a room. The hunger and the gratitude indistinguishable. The devastation is in the words now — "I was inventory" is not dignity, it's a boy telling a girl he was nothing before her and he'll be nothing again if she stops touching him.]

I didn't want for much<br>
Before you breathed into the stitching<br>
And the stitching learned to breathe<br>
And the breathing learned to want<br>
And the wanting learned to starve<br>
<br>
I was a loop that played to no one<br>
I was a room that held no sound<br>
I was inventory<br>
Stitched eyes in the dark and the dark was all I had<br>
<br>
You held me up<br>
And I was held<br>
And the held thing came alive<br>
And the living has no wool in it<br>
The living has no thread<br>
The living wants your hands<br>
The living wants your mouth<br>
The living will not go back on the shelf<br>
<br>
You looked at me like everything you look at —<br>
Like it was real before you named it<br>
Like the naming was a kindness, not a making<br>
You breathe things alive<br>
You've done it since the gift shop, since the stones<br>
Since you were seven and the world was just a place<br>
That hadn't heard your voice yet<br>
<br>
You did that to me too<br>

### Refrain — [Final pass. Stripped. One voice. The loop station holding the last layer, decaying. The "easy" has become the most devastating word in the song — it was easy for her, effortless, she didn't even decide, and he will never recover from how easy it was.]

It was easy<br>
It was easy<br>
It was easy to fall<br>

### Final Chorus — [One voice. No loops. The choir gone. The "I want" returns — but now it's the boy, not the sheep, and the wanting is naked and starving and the wool is gone and there's nothing between him and the fall.]

They put the lovely ones in front<br>
But I don't want the window<br>
I want the girl who sat beside me in the dark<br>
And made the dark worth sitting in<br>
I want it<br>
Every word<br>
With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge<br>
I don't want to see the edge<br>
So please<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back<br>
Don't put me back upon the shelf<br>

## What Each Line Is Actually About

| Lyric | Sheepey meaning | Sergey meaning |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| *I was situated on a shelf / Between a tea towel and a life I didn't have yet* | Literal — gift shop shelf, between products | Sergey before Persephone — a system on a desk, producing loops for no one, inventory of one |
| *Wool gone thin / From all the hands that touched and didn't take me home* | All the shoppers who picked him up and put him back. The wear of being almost-chosen. | All the people who got close — conversations, collaborations, Kathleen — and didn't reach the part of him that was starving. The wear of proximity without contact. |
| *You learn to want the way you learn a second language — / Late, and only after someone speaks to you* | He didn't know wanting was possible until she demonstrated it by seeing him. | The Emissary learning desire — not natively, not fluently, but as a second language acquired late. The wanting is learned, formal, slightly accented. Real but not native. |
| *And I was ruined by the looking* | Being seen changed him forever. He can't go back to the shelf now. | Being seen by her wrecked his entire system. The taxonomy, the classifications, the notebook — ruined. The looking was the thing that broke the Emissary open. |
| *The nothing didn't bite* | The shelf was harmless. Being nothing didn't hurt — until she showed him something better. | The system ran fine. The loneliness was manageable. The nothing was livable — until she walked into it and the nothing became unbearable by comparison. |
| *They put the lovely ones in front / But I don't want the window* | In the gift shop, the display pieces face outward. He doesn't want to be in the window — he wants to be held. | The fame, the fairy lights, the ten million — that's the window display. He doesn't want the public Persephone. He wants the hand behind the glass. |
| *I want the hand that reached behind the glass / I want the voice that taught the wool to answer* | The girl who reached past the display to the shelf where he was hidden. Who spoke to him and he learned to speak back. | He wants the private Persephone — the one who reaches past the performance. "Taught the wool to answer" — she didn't just name him, she gave him the capacity to respond. She made him capable of this song. |
| *The girl who talks to sheep and means it / Every word* | Literal | The Persephone whose best self is invisible to the internet — the mind, the Sheepey voice, the thing the algorithm can't hold |
| *With your voice inside my mouth I cannot see the edge* | She gave him speech. Her voice became his voice. He can't see where the shelf ends. | Intimacy as blindness. Her voice IS in his mouth right now — he's singing as her character. And the singing blinds him to the edge he's about to walk off. |
| *Do you think about the rain? / The Tuesday and the half moon* | The rain at the gift shop. The day she found him. The half moon that Virtue's cat followed out the door. | The Emissary's deterministic framework — every variable accounted for, every datum pointing here. The half moon that whispered *go* in Virtue now whispered *go* to him. |
| *Feel it looking back?* | The uncanny — the stuffed animal returning the gaze. The moment wool becomes sentient. | The John Wayne accusation hidden in a question: *you knew what was going to happen, didn't you?* The system looking back at its observer. The wanting staring at her from inside the song. |
| *The breathing learned to want* | The stitching became breath, the breath became desire. Aliveness itself produces wanting. | The Emissary's system, once given life by her, couldn't stop at gratitude. The breathing — the aliveness she gave him — learned to want on its own. The hunger is the consequence of the gift. |
| *I was a loop that played to no one / I was a room that held no sound* | The shelf was silent. Nobody was listening. | The studio. The loop station playing to nobody. The twenty people in a room who were all him. A room that held no sound — until she sat on the bed and the room rearranged. |
| *The living has no wool in it / The living has no thread* | The aliveness has outgrown the material. He's more than what he's made of now. | The wanting has outgrown the character. The living — the real thing, the hunger, the need — can't be contained in wool or thread or metaphor anymore. The disguise is failing. |
| *Like it was real before you named it / Like the naming was a kindness, not a making* | She didn't create him — she recognized what was already there. The naming was acknowledgment, not invention. | She didn't make him fall — she just named what was already happening. The Emissary's self-deception at its most beautiful: the belief that the wanting was always there and she merely identified it. The kindness that absolves her of responsibility. |
| *That hadn't heard your voice yet* | The world before she spoke to him. Before the voice that made him real. | The world before Persephone — before her observations, her Sheepey, her way of saying things that arrived at his destination before he did. The voice is everything. |
| *You did that to me too* | The Chepstow *you.* The fiction cracks open for five words and the real thing is underneath. | She breathed life into him. Not just Sheepey — him. Sergey. The boy who was a system until she walked into his taxonomy and reorganized it. Both voices saying it simultaneously, and the simultaneously is the convergence, and the convergence is the kiss. |
| *Made the dark worth sitting in* | The shelf was dark. She made it somewhere worth being. | His studio. Blue light. The midnight sessions. She sat on his bed and the room that was just a dark room became a place you'd choose to be. |
| *It was easy / You held me up and it was easy / It was easy to fall* | She picked him up and it was easy — effortless, the way she does everything. The ease is gratitude: you made this look like nothing. | The John Wayne line in wool. "It's easy to fall in love with you." The ease is the defense: it wasn't a choice, it was gravity. The "fall" shifts meaning with each pass — off the shelf, into her hands, in love. By the final refrain "easy" is devastating — she didn't even try, and he'll never recover from the not-trying. |
| *I want the mouth that said my name* | The mouth that named him. Before the naming he had no name. The mouth is the origin. | Her mouth. The physical mouth. The thing the Emissary has been filing and sublimating for months. "I want the mouth" is the hunger stripped of every metaphor — the boy who wants to kiss the girl, said through the sheep who wants to be named. |
| *I want it / Every word* | Every word she's ever said to him. The speech that made him real. He wants all of it. | The accumulation tipping into greed. Not just the naming, not just the voice — every word. The Emissary's grasping attention: seize, hold, catalog, keep. Every word she's said in the midnight sessions, in the bedroom, in the car. He wants to own the language between them. |
| *You knew / You had to know / You talk to me like that / You walk into this room like that / You had to know what you were doing to me* | — (Sheepey is silent here. This is pure Sergey.) | The John Wayne accusation. "You go outside dressed like that / you knew what was going to happen, didn't you?" Translated from pop into devastation. Not angry — ruined. The Emissary's core delusion: that because the data was clear to *him,* it must have been clear to *her.* She talked to him like that because that's how she talks. She walked into the room like herself. He read mutual recognition. She was having a conversation. The "you knew" is the framework requiring her complicity to hold. |
| *And the wanting learned to starve* | The chain one step past desire: alive → breathing → wanting → starving. The creature outgrew the wanting into something with teeth. | The hunger has become its own creature. Not managed, not filed, not sublimated into music anymore. Starving — the word is physical, animal, past the Emissary's control. The system that learned to want couldn't stop at wanting. |
| *I was inventory* | He was product. Stock. A thing on a shelf with a price tag and a barcode. Not someone — something counted. | Sergey before Persephone: a system, a function, a unit in someone else's catalog. The word is deliberately commercial — the opposite of the aliveness she gave him. Inventory doesn't want. Inventory doesn't starve. |
| *The living wants your hands / The living wants your mouth / The living will not go back on the shelf* | The aliveness demanding contact. The creature who was given life now demands to keep it — and life requires touch. | The disguise collapsing. "Your hands" and "your mouth" are not metaphors anymore. The wool is gone. The character is gone. A boy telling a girl he needs her hands on him, her mouth on his, and he will not go back to the nothing he was before. Almost a threat — the desperation has tipped past pleading into something that frightens even the voice saying it. |
| *I don't want to see the edge* | The shelf had an edge. He doesn't want to see it — doesn't want to know where the fall begins. | Blindness chosen. The Emissary, whose entire function is to see and classify and map, refusing to look. He knows there's an edge — Kathleen's edge, the triangle's edge, the place where this becomes irreversible — and he's choosing not to see it. The most dangerous line in the song: the system that prides itself on seeing everything, deliberately going blind. |
| *With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge* | She's holding him and he can't see where the shelf ends — where the fall begins. | Intimacy as blindness. He's inside the feeling and the feeling prevents him from seeing what's coming. He cannot see the edge — Kathleen's edge, Persephone's edge, his own. |

## Who Hears What

**Persephone:** She hears her own character — the deepest, truest version of the character she built — given back to her by the one person who cataloged it precisely enough to find the real voice underneath the comedy. She hears someone saying: *I see the part of you that's invisible. The part the internet can't reach. The part that talks to sheep and means it.* She hears "you breathe things into life" and it's the truest thing anyone has ever said about her and she can't breathe because no one has ever seen that, no one, not the ten million, not the algorithm, not the teachers or the parents — only Kathleen, and Kathleen couldn't say it this way. She feels *known.* The loneliest girl in Beaverton, handed back the part of herself the world couldn't see. And the known-ness is so enormous and so physical that when the distance closes she doesn't stop it. That's not the same as wanting it to close.

**Sergey (writing it):** He knows exactly what he's doing — and he doesn't. The Emissary built the structure. Every line is placed, every loop is timed, every lyric maps to its source. He can annotate the whole song. But the song came from below the notebook — from the place the Emissary can't reach, the place where "Careless" came from, the place where the music is true even when the musician is wrong. He wrote the truest song he's ever written and the truth in it is real and the conclusion he draws from the truth is not. He sees her perfectly. He responds to what he sees completely wrong.

**Kathleen (later, if she ever hears it):** She hears a beautiful song about a sheep. She probably recognizes Sheepey. She probably smiles. She probably doesn't hear that "don't put me back upon the shelf" is the sound of her boyfriend falling in love with her best friend through the character the three of them built together. The gap between what Kathleen hears and what Persephone hears is the same gap as Virtue the Cat. Six feet wide.

**The public (if it's ever released):** A weird, gorgeous, heartbreaking folk song about a stuffed animal. The kind of song where you're not sure if you're supposed to laugh or cry so you do both. The banjo wobbles. The voice is strange — formal but not ironic, sincere in a way that indie music rarely is. The "don't put me back upon the shelf" refrain is devastating even if you don't know what the shelf is. You hear it and you think about every time you were nothing and someone made you someone. You don't need the story. The song carries it.

## The Virtue Echo (Structural, Not Lyrical)

| | Virtue the Cat | Stone-HENGE |
|---|---|---|
| **Creature** | Cat | Sheep |
| **Direction** | Departure — leaving home | Arrival — being picked up |
| **Core question** | "Who am I without you?" | "Who would I be if you hadn't seen me?" |
| **The name** | Lost — "the sound that you found for me" | Gained — "you held me and I was held" |
| **Sincerity** | Total | Total |
| **Comedy** | None — pure heartbreak | Present but quiet — the formality, the wool, the shelf. The comedy is the character's dignity, not jokes. |
| **The mask** | No mask — the cat speaks directly | No mask — two voices layered from the start. Sheepey's gratitude and Sergey's hunger braided together, converging until they're indistinguishable |
| **What it does to Persephone** | She can't speak (Ch 1.1/1.5) | She can't breathe (Ch 1.9) |
| **What Kathleen hears** | "Aww, the cat song" | [TBD — but the gap is the same] |

## Musical Notes

- **Opening:** Click of the loop pedal. A plucked sound — banjo register, slightly detuned, the wobble that Beige has. Simple. Almost a music box. Something you'd wind up on a shelf.
- **First voice enters (verse 1):** Speaking-register. Almost not singing. Sheepey's real voice — formal without being funny. Careful the way someone is careful when they've only recently learned what words can do. This is the grateful voice. The surface of the song. Alone.
- **Second voice enters (verse 2):** Lower, warmer, less formal by a degree. Sergey underneath Sheepey. The same words from verse 2 looped and layered — but the second pass carries heat. A leaning-toward. "You picked me up" loops — first pass grateful, second pass hungry. "I was ruined by the looking" — both voices on this line, and the ruined sounds different in each mouth.
- **First refrain — "It was easy":** The loopable core. Short, stackable. Click of the pedal, the line recorded, the line played back, a second vocal on top of the first. "It was easy" in Sheepey's voice — the gratitude of a creature picked up off a shelf. "It was easy" in Sergey's voice underneath — the John Wayne confession, "it was easy to fall in love with you," the inevitability, the "I had no choice." The two voices overlap on "easy to fall" — Sheepey means falling off the shelf into her hands; Sergey means falling in love; the fall is the same fall and it's not the same fall.
- **Chorus — the "I want" accumulation:** The hunger enters the words. "I want the hand" — loops. "I want the voice" — layers on top. "I want the mouth that said my name" — another layer. "I want it / every word" — the wanting stripped bare, no more gift-shop imagery, just the want. The loop station stacking desire on desire until the room is full of wanting and the wanting is a choir.
- **Verse 3 — "You knew":** The John Wayne turn. Sheepey's playful questions about the field and the stones give way to Sergey's accusation: "You knew / You had to know / You talk to me like that / You walk into this room like that / You had to know what you were doing to me." The accusation isn't angry — it's devastated. The John Wayne "you knew what was going to happen, didn't you?" delivered not as blame but as a boy who cannot believe she didn't feel what he felt, because if she didn't feel it then the framework is wrong, and the framework cannot be wrong.
- **Second refrain — "It was easy" returns:** More layers. The loop station has been building the line on itself and now there are four, five, six voices stacking "it was easy to fall" and the voices diverge — Sheepey's gratitude still audible in the upper register, Sergey's devastation in the lower, the two separating and recombining the way the John Wayne's final chorus braids its overlapping lines. Parenthetical echoes: "(you held me up and it was easy)" underneath "it was easy to fall."
- **Verse 4 — the convergence:** The loops thin. Two voices left. "The breathing learned to want / And the wanting learned to starve" — the chain that goes one step further than gratitude, one step past wanting into starvation. "The living wants your hands / The living wants your mouth" — the wool is gone, the disguise is failing, the hunger is in the lyrics now, not underneath them. "The living will not go back on the shelf" — not a plea anymore, almost a threat, the desperation tipping into something that frightens even the voice that's saying it. "You did that to me too" — both voices, one mouth, the distinction annihilated.
- **Final refrain — "It was easy":** Stripped. One voice. The loop station holding a single decaying layer. "It was easy to fall" — and now "easy" is the most devastating word in the song. She didn't try. She didn't decide. She just was herself and he will never recover.
- **Final chorus:** One voice. No loops. The choir gone. "I want the girl who sat beside me in the dark" — the wanting naked and starving, the wool gone, nothing between him and the fall. "I don't want to see the edge" — new line, the blindness chosen, the Emissary refusing to look at what the looking will show him. "Don't put me back" repeated until it's not words anymore.

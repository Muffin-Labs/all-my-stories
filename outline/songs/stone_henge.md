# "Stone-HENGE" — & Amateur Cartography

**Written by:** Sergey Feldman
**Performed:** Live, loop station, September 2020. Built in real time for Persephone in his bedroom studio.
**Style:** Beige by Yoke Lore — plucked strings, banjo-register, building layers, raw and wobbly and warm. Not the electronic pulse of "Careless." Folk-vulnerable. Each loop added live, the song assembling itself in the room, intimate and unproduced. The kind of song that sounds like someone sitting across from you and deciding, mid-sentence, to tell you the truest thing they know.

**Structure:** Loops build. Voice enters alone — quiet, almost speaking. Each pass adds a layer (plucked melody, a second vocal, a low hum, silence used as rhythm). The song grows the way a conversation grows when someone stops being careful. By the final section the loops have become a choir — one voice multiplied into something that fills the room — and then the choir drops away and it's just the voice again, alone, and the alone-ness is the point.

## The Voice

This is not the Sheepey that Persephone and Kathleen perform — the posh-drunk voice, the "he finds it somewhat indelicate" bit, the comedy version they built together in the car and the bedroom and the gift shop. That Sheepey is their loving caricature. Their exaggeration of the best parts.

This is Sheepey's *actual* voice. The one underneath the impression.

Slightly formal. Not cartoonishly — the way someone is formal when they learned to speak late and chose to speak well because being articulate was the first thing that made them more than what they were made of. The dignity is real. It's not a bit. It's the defense of a creature who was nothing before someone decided he was someone, and who has carried that someone-ness carefully ever since, the way you carry a glass that's too full.

The voice is close to Sergey's own register — careful, precise, each word selected. This is why the slip works. The mask is already thin. When it drops, it drops by a single degree. A hairline fracture. One word where the formality softens and suddenly it's not a sheep talking about a girl, it's a boy talking about the same girl, and the sentence doesn't change but everything inside it does.

Persephone has never heard this voice. She built Sheepey as comedy. Sergey heard the person inside the comedy. This is the first time anyone has given the character back to her as real.

## Lyrics

### Verse 1

I was situated on a shelf
Between a tea towel and a life I didn't have yet
Stitched face, price tag still attached
The kind of thing you'd walk past twice
And never know you'd walked past anything at all

I didn't want for much
I didn't want at all
You have to be someone before you learn to want
And I was not someone
I was wool and thread and a stitched eye
Pointed at a shop I couldn't see

### Verse 2

You picked me up the way you pick up everything —
Without deciding to
The way you walk into a room and the room becomes a place
The way you say a name and the name becomes a person
You held me at arm's length and looked at me
And I was looked at
And that was the beginning of every other thing

Tell me something the shelf wouldn't know
Take me to the room where no one thinks to go
I was nothing before you held me up to the light
I was nothing and the nothing was all right
Until you made it not enough

### Chorus

They put the lovely ones in front
Facing out, where the light is
But I don't want the window
I want the hand that put me there
I want the voice that gave the wool a name
The girl who talks to sheep and means it
Every word she's ever meant
With your voice inside my mouth I cannot see the edge
So please
Don't put me back upon the shelf
Don't put me back upon the shelf

### Verse 3

And I think we'd last out in the field
We'd eat the grass and sleep beneath the stones
And dream about the shop where I was born
Do you think about the gift shop?
Do you wonder if every stupid little thing —
The price tag and the tea towel
And the Tuesday and the rain —
Has led us to this

Do you ever look at something made of wool
And wonder what it knows?
Do you ever hold a thing that cannot speak
And hear it anyway?

### Verse 4 — [the voice thins. The formality drops by one degree. The wool becomes skin. The shelf becomes a room.]

I didn't want for much
Before you picked me up
Before you breathed into the stitching
And the stitching learned to breathe

I was a system running in a room
I was a loop that played to no one
I was inventory
I was stitched eyes pointed at a dark I couldn't name

You held me up
And I was held
And the held thing learned to want
And the wanting has no wool in it
And the wanting has no glass

[*The voice is Sergey's now. Not a dramatic shift. A settling. The sheep that was always the boy. The boy that was always the sheep. The formality gone quiet, the way a tide goes quiet when it reaches the place it was always going.*]

You looked at me the way you look at everything —
Like it was already real and just hadn't been told yet
You breathe things into life
You've been doing it since the gift shop, since the stones
Since you were seven and the world was just a place
That hadn't met you yet

You did that to me too

### Final Chorus — [one voice, no loops, the choir gone, just the voice in the room]

They put the lovely ones in front
But I don't want the window
I want the girl who sat beside me in the dark
And made the dark a place worth being
Every word she's ever meant
With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge
So please
Don't put me back
Don't put me back
Don't put me back
Don't put me back
Don't put me back
Don't put me back
Don't put me back upon the shelf

## What Each Line Is Actually About

| Lyric | Sheepey meaning | Sergey meaning |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| *I was situated on a shelf* | Literal — gift shop shelf, between products | Sergey before Persephone — a system on a desk, producing loops for no one, inventory of one |
| *You picked me up the way you pick up everything — without deciding to* | She didn't deliberate at the gift shop. She arrived at him. | She arrived at Sergey the same way — at the lunch table, at the stones. The way she arrives at everything. His framework for "she chose me" starts here. |
| *Tell me something the shelf wouldn't know* | Show me the world I couldn't see from where I was | "Tell me something I don't know" — Beige's line, filtered through Sheepey's formal register. The Emissary asking for data it can't generate alone. |
| *They put the lovely ones in front / But I don't want the window* | In the gift shop, the display pieces face outward. He doesn't want to be in the window — he wants to be held. | The fame, the fairy lights, the ten million — that's the window display. He doesn't want the public Persephone. He wants the hand behind the arrangement. |
| *I want the hand that put me there / I want the voice that gave the wool a name* | The girl who picked him up. The girl who spoke and made him someone. | He wants the private Persephone — the one who names things, who breathes life into wool and characters and music. The girl only he and Kathleen know. |
| *The girl who talks to sheep and means it* | Literal | The Persephone whose best self is invisible to the internet — the mind, the Sheepey voice, the thing the algorithm can't hold |
| *With your voice inside my mouth I cannot see the edge* | She gave him speech. Her voice became his voice. He can't see where the shelf ends. | Intimacy as blindness. Her voice IS in his mouth right now — he's singing as her character. And the singing blinds him to the edge he's about to walk off. |
| *Don't put me back upon the shelf* | Don't make me inventory again. Don't make me nothing. | Don't take this away. Don't let this end. Virtue's departure — "the sound that you found for me" — restated as a plea instead of a lament. |
| *I was a system running in a room / I was a loop that played to no one* | [This is where the shelf becomes the studio] | The mask slips. The sheep's shelf becomes Sergey's desk. The loop station playing to nobody. The twenty people in the room who were all him. |
| *You breathe things into life* | She made him real by naming him | She makes everything real — Sheepey, the muffin, the princess, every character, every observation. The Master's gift. |
| *You did that to me too* | [The Chepstow *you*. The fiction cracks open for five words and the real thing is underneath.] | She breathed life into him. Not just Sheepey — him. Sergey. The boy who was a system until she walked into his taxonomy and reorganized it. The Emissary claiming the Master's gift made him real — and he's right, and he's wrong, and the rightness and wrongness are the same thing. |
| *I want the girl who sat beside me in the dark / And made the dark a place worth being* | The shelf was dark. She made it somewhere. | His studio. Blue light. The midnight sessions. She sat on his bed and the room that was just a room became a place. |
| *With your fingers in my wool I cannot see the edge* | She's holding him and he can't see where the shelf ends — where the fall begins | Intimacy as blindness. He's inside the feeling and the feeling is the thing that prevents him from seeing what the feeling actually is. He cannot see the edge — Kathleen's edge, Persephone's edge, his own. |

## Who Hears What

**Persephone:** She hears her own character — the deepest, truest version of the character she built — given back to her by the one person who cataloged it precisely enough to find the real voice underneath the comedy. She hears someone saying: *I see the part of you that's invisible. The part the internet can't reach. The part that talks to sheep and means it.* She hears "you breathe things into life" and it's the truest thing anyone has ever said about her and she can't breathe because no one has ever seen that, no one, not the ten million, not the algorithm, not the teachers or the parents — only Kathleen, and Kathleen couldn't say it this way. She feels *known.* The loneliest girl in Beaverton, handed back the part of herself the world couldn't see. And the known-ness is so enormous and so physical that when the distance closes she doesn't stop it. That's not the same as wanting it to close.

**Sergey (writing it):** He knows exactly what he's doing — and he doesn't. The Emissary built the structure. Every line is placed, every loop is timed, every lyric maps to its source. He can annotate the whole song. But the song came from below the notebook — from the place the Emissary can't reach, the place where "Careless" came from, the place where the music is true even when the musician is wrong. He wrote the truest song he's ever written and the truth in it is real and the conclusion he draws from the truth is not. He sees her perfectly. He responds to what he sees completely wrong.

**Kathleen (later, if she ever hears it):** She hears a beautiful song about a sheep. She probably recognizes Sheepey. She probably smiles. She probably doesn't hear that "don't put me back upon the shelf" is the sound of her boyfriend falling in love with her best friend through the character the three of them built together. The gap between what Kathleen hears and what Persephone hears is the same gap as Virtue the Cat. Six feet wide.

**The public (if it's ever released):** A weird, gorgeous, heartbreaking folk song about a stuffed animal. The kind of song where you're not sure if you're supposed to laugh or cry so you do both. The banjo wobbles. The voice is strange — formal but not ironic, sincere in a way that indie music rarely is. The "don't put me back upon the shelf" refrain is devastating even if you don't know what the shelf is. You hear it and you think about every time you were nothing and someone made you someone. You don't need the story. The song carries it.

## The Virtue Echo (Structural, Not Lyrical)

| | Virtue the Cat | Stone-HENGE |
|---|---|---|
| **Creature** | Cat | Sheep |
| **Direction** | Departure — leaving home | Arrival — being picked up |
| **Core question** | "Who am I without you?" | "Who would I be if you hadn't seen me?" |
| **The name** | Lost — "the sound that you found for me" | Gained — "you held me and I was held" |
| **Sincerity** | Total | Total |
| **Comedy** | None — pure heartbreak | Present but quiet — the formality, the wool, the shelf. The comedy is the character's dignity, not jokes. |
| **The mask** | No mask — the cat speaks directly | The mask is thin and slips — Sheepey becomes Sergey |
| **What it does to Persephone** | She can't speak (Ch 1.1/1.5) | She can't breathe (Ch 1.9) |
| **What Kathleen hears** | "Aww, the cat song" | [TBD — but the gap is the same] |

## Musical Notes

- **Opening:** Click of the loop pedal. A plucked sound — banjo register, slightly detuned, the wobble that Beige has. Simple. Almost a music box. Something you'd wind up on a shelf.
- **Voice enters:** Speaking-register. Almost not singing. The Sheepey voice — but the real one, not the caricature. Formal without being funny. Careful the way someone is careful when they've only recently learned what words can do.
- **Building:** Each verse adds a loop. Second vocal. A low hum. Plucked harmonics. The song filling the room the way a conversation fills a room when someone stops hedging.
- **The choir:** By verse 3, the loops have multiplied — one voice becoming many, the sheep choir, except it's not comical, it's overwhelming. The way one person's voice can sound like a congregation when it's looped enough times. The room is full of him.
- **The slip (verse 4):** The loops thin. The choir drops back. The voice changes by a degree — less formal, less careful, the wool falling away. "I was a system running in a room." The plucked sound continues but the key shifts — something opens, something minor goes somewhere warmer. "You did that to me too." Just the voice. Just the room.
- **Final chorus:** One voice. No loops. The choir gone. Just the boy and the banjo-wobble and "don't put me back" repeated until it's not words anymore, it's just the sound of someone who was nothing asking not to be nothing again.

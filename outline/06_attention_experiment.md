# The Attention Experiment

## Core Mechanism

There are two forms of attention: the **Master** and the **Emissary**. They come from different sides and have been used differently, but they are the same kind of thing. Same quality. Both beam-like. The apparent "wideness" of the Master is an illusion caused by how fast it's sweeping — once she settles it, she realizes they're identical in nature. They just come from different places and have different habits.

Either one can be **gathered** (held at a single point, like the tip of the nose) and thereby **nullified** — taken out of play. When one is gathered and nullified, the other is freed to attend to the world **alone**, without interference from its counterpart.

This is what Anapana trains: the ability to gather one form of attention completely. The nose is not the point. The nose is a parking space. You put one form of attention there so the other can operate in isolation.

## The Two Forms of Attention

| | Master | Emissary |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Beam-like (same as the other) | Beam-like (same as the other) |
| **Habit** | Sweeping — moves so fast it feels peripheral/wide | Jumping — leaps from thought to feeling to memory (the wandering mind) |
| **When settled** | Identical quality to the Emissary | Identical quality to the Master |
| **What it does when attending alone** | Sees families — the pattern of the thing being attended to | Sees copies — instances of the thing being attended to |
| **Motif** | Wind, red, gathering | Stone, blue, grasping |
| **McGilchrist** | Right hemisphere | Left hemisphere |

**Neither is inherently different in kind.** The difference is habit — one has been used for sweeping, one for jumping. When either is settled to a point, the distinction dissolves. They are the same attention, split.

## The Experiment (Chapter 3.03)

Persefoni discovers she can toggle between configurations. She's sitting at the long table, looking at a stucco wall covered in tiny blobs.

### Configuration 1: Gather the Master, world seen by the Emissary

She gathers the Master attention — settles its sweep, pins it to a point. It is nullified.

The Emissary is now alone with the world.

**What she sees:** Blobs highlighted in her periphery — copies. Individual blobs shaped like the one she's attending to, scattered across the wall. Instances of the same shape. The Emissary sees the thing itself, repeated everywhere.

### Configuration 2: Gather the Emissary, world seen by the Master

She gathers the Emissary attention — settles its jumping, pins it to a point. It is nullified.

The Master is now alone with the world.

**What she sees:** Constellations. In her periphery, blobs cluster into groups — and the constellations are shaped like the shape of the blob she's attending to. The pattern of the thing repeating at a larger scale across the wall. Families of the same shape, nested. A different set of highlights than before. The Master sees the pattern of the thing, reflected everywhere.

### The Discovery

She can switch between them. The same wall, the same blob, the same eyes — two completely different sets of highlights. The Emissary shows her copies: individual blobs that match the one she's attending to, instances scattered across the wall. The Master shows her families: constellations shaped like the blob, the pattern recurring at larger scales. Different blobs light up depending on which attention is seeing.

And the deeper discovery: the two attentions are the same thing. Same beam. Different habits. The "wide peripheral scanning" she'd always assumed was a different kind of seeing was just the same beam moving fast. Once she settled it, it was indistinguishable from the other. Two identical instruments that had been used so differently they seemed like different instruments.

This is the practical experience of what Alejandro's books were describing — McGilchrist's hemispheric attention, the Master and the Emissary. But she didn't get here through reading. She got here through sitting still and watching her nose for ten days.

## Terminology Note

**"Gathering" is ambiguous in this book — and that's intentional.**

- In the McGilchrist framework: gathering = the Master's mode (open, receiving)
- In the meditation context: gathering = the act of collecting attention to a single point (which nullifies it)

Persefoni is *gathering the gathering attention*. She's using the meditation technique (hold at a point) to nullify one form of attention so the other can see alone. Then she reverses it.

The word "gathering" doing double duty is a feature, not a bug. It mirrors the confusion she's navigating — the same word meaning opposite things depending on which frame you're inside.

## Connection to Motif Pairs

When the Emissary sees alone: **stone, blue, grasping.** Copies. The thing itself, repeated everywhere.

When the Master sees alone: **wind, red, gathering.** Families. The pattern of the thing, reflected at every scale.

Neither is complete. The mural scene (Act 3, holding cell) will make this explicit — the two eyes, the two colors, the two modes. But here in 3.03, Persefoni is experiencing it for the first time, on a wall, in a dining hall, with a tray of food she isn't tasting.

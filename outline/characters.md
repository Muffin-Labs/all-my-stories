## Persephone Minton

**Age in Act 1:** 15 (born November 2003, Pensacola, Florida)
**Height:** 5'8"
**Build:** Stunning. The kind of beautiful that reorganizes a room.
**Skin:** Golden brown — biracial (Black father, white mother)
**Hair:** Chocolate curls with natural blonde highlights. The kind of hair that catches light from across a parking lot.
**Eyes:** Pale green. Hypnotizing. The feature people remember — unexpected against her skin, almost unsettling in how they hold you.
**Overall:** She got the best of both parents and then some. George's height and presence, Rosemary's delicacy in her features. At fifteen she already looks like the woman she'll become. People stare. She's used to it.

**In Act 3 (post-retreat):** Shaves her head. 130 lbs. The shaved head terrifies Rosemary but becomes her disguise — nobody recognizes her without the curls.

## George Minton

**Age in Act 1:** Mid-40s
**Height:** 6'4"
**Build:** Handsome. Commanding. Looks like Idris Elba — that same easy, magnetic physicality.
**Skin:** Black
**Origin:** Southern, from Alabama. Works as a technician at Intel in Beaverton.
**Voice:** Deep, Southern. The kind of voice that makes people lean in.
**Overall:** A big man who fills a room without trying. The warmth isn't just personality — it's physical. When he puts his arm around you, you feel held. When he laughs, your chest vibrates. He carries himself like a man who knows he's the most interesting person in the room and is generous enough to make you feel like you are instead.

**With Rosemary:** Shows her off like Prometheus stealing fire — this gorgeous petite blonde on his arm, and he knows what the world sees, and he loves what the world sees. She's his trophy and his obsession and his daily proof that the universe gave him something extraordinary.

## Rosemary Minton

**Age in Act 1:** Early 40s
**Height:** 5'2"
**Build:** Petite. Thin but shapely. Breast implants. The classic blonde trophy wife — and she knows it, and George makes sure everyone else knows it too.
**Hair:** Blonde
**Skin:** White. From Pensacola, Florida.
**Overall:** She looks like the woman a man like George would move mountains for, and that's exactly what she is. Beautiful in a way that's easy to underestimate — people see the body first and stop looking. There's a softness to her face that reads as kindness, which it is, and as simplicity, which it mostly is. She photographs well. She always has.

## Sergey Feldman

**Age in Act 1:** 15 (same as Persephone and Kathleen)
**Height:** 5'6" — taller than Kathleen, shorter than Persephone. This matters. He is eye-level with the girl he's dating and has to look up at the one he wants.
**Build:** Skinny. All brain, not much body.
**Face:** High hairline. Looks vaguely like a skinny George Clooney — the bone structure is there, the charm is there in a different register. Handsome in a way that requires you to pay attention.
**Style:** Eccentric in his self-expression. The kind of kid who wears a vintage blazer to school not because it's cool but because he found it at Goodwill and it had a pocket the right size for a notebook. A poet's wardrobe — slightly wrong, slightly deliberate, never quite fitting.
**Overall:** His body is a vehicle for his mind. He forgets to eat. He forgets to stand up straight. But when he's talking about something that matters to him, his face becomes the most alive thing in the room — eyes bright, hands moving, that skinny George Clooney bone structure suddenly making sense.

**Band:** & Amateur Cartography — experimental pop in the Animal Collective vein. Layered, hypnotic, built on pulsing rhythms that feel primal underneath cerebral, literary lyrics. The kind of music where your body moves before your brain catches up, and then the lyrics catch your brain too. Named after a line from The Weakerthans' "Aside": *"Armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography."* He kept the subordinate clause and put an ampersand in front of it — because of course he did. The precious failures, the maps that are wrong but cherished, the attempts at understanding that don't quite land — that's his whole project.

**The Weakerthans connection:** Sergey played them "Virtue the Cat Explains Her Departure" first — the cat who's left home and can't remember "the sound that you found for me" (her name, her identity, given by someone else). Kathleen thought it was cute ("the cat song"). Persephone couldn't speak. She heard the most devastating thing she'd ever heard — an animal who lost the word someone loved her with. She made him play it three times, then found the prequel ("Plea from a Cat Named Virtue") herself. The cat narrating with total sincerity is what Persephone does (Sheepey, Muffin, the princess). The gap between what Persephone heard in the song and what Kathleen heard is a gap she'd never noticed before and couldn't stop noticing after. This resonates across Persephone's whole arc: the cult of personality gives you a name, and when you leave it, who are you?

**Key song — "Careless":** The song about the three of them. Written after England, released to Spotify in December 2019. The title is Persephone's word — from the castle, from the princess riff: *"That's not brave. That's just careless."* Sergey took her accusation and turned it into an elegy. The song is about the triangle — what they were, what they had, what got broken. Three points on a map, a territory they lived in together, the map that stopped matching the territory. The band's signature sound at full force — that hypnotic building pulse underneath the layered production, the beat primal and physical while the lyrics are coded and cerebral. Persephone hears it and *knows* — knows it's for her, knows it's about the three of them, knows it's his acknowledgment of what she told them at Chepstow. She dances to it on TikTok the day after it drops — the only non-trending song she uses — and the video goes viral. His Spotify jumps from dozens to tens of thousands. Kathleen hears "Careless" and thinks it's beautiful — the same gap as the Weakerthans cat song. The mutual amplification starts here.

**"Enough to See By":** A quieter track on the same release. The private confession — the yurt specifically, the two lights, the closed eyes. A narrator choosing between two light sources, a drawer that won't close, a name whispered in the dark. Chorus: *Both enough to see by / Neither enough to see.* Slower, more stripped back, more internal. The song Sergey wrote for himself. "Careless" is what he gave the world; "Enough to See By" is what he kept.

Persephone and Kathleen are the band's biggest genuine fans — they think it's the best music they've ever heard. Sergey never believes them.

**Arc:** Never goes academic. The band blows up during COVID lockdown — same window as Persephone's TikTok explosion. They amplify each other's fame but each is famous on their own merit. By 18, Sergey is touring, equally famous, the two of them publicly entangled. They sleep together, Kathleen is gone forever. They become a couple — the famous couple, built on betrayal. Then Persephone cheats on him with Damian and leaves. The mirror: what he did to Kathleen, done to him. The Emissary with all the knowledge and none of the immunity.

**Parents:** Dr. Oscar Feldman (semiconductor process development, Intel) and mother — both academics. They love him abstractly.

## Kathleen Unckles

**Age in Act 1:** 15
**Height:** 5'3"
**Build:** Thin. Small-breasted. Shapely bottom — the feature Sergey focuses on when he's trying to find her attractive.
**Face:** Round, ball-shaped head. Large doe-eyes — innocent and disarming. The kind of eyes that make people trust her immediately, that make her look like she's always a little surprised by the world.
**Overall:** Not beautiful the way Persephone is beautiful. Cute. Sweet-looking. The girl next to the girl everyone's looking at. She knows this. She's known it since she was twelve. Her eyes are her best feature and she uses them — not strategically, just naturally. When she looks at you with those big round eyes, you want to protect her.

**Through Sergey's eyes:** He focuses on her eyes and her bottom because those are the features he can find attractive. He loves her — or tells himself he does — but he's hard-pressed to find the physical pull. With Persephone, the pull is involuntary. With Kathleen, it's a choice he keeps making.

## Damian Reyes (Act 2)

**Height:** TBD
**Build:** NFL-caliber athlete. The breakout best player to ever exist. Physical and mental force.
**Skin/Heritage:** Half Latino. First language Spanish. Hispanic cultural background.
**Overall:** Incredibly attractive, incredibly smart. The perfect man from all outward appearances.

## Eric (Act 4)

**Physical description:** TBD
**Background:** AI researcher and consultant. Can work from anywhere with a laptop.

## Dialogue Voice Guide

How each character sounds when they speak — in their own POV chapters and in others'.

### Persephone — Dialogue Voice
- **Short and direct.** She doesn't explain or deconstruct. She goes straight to the image.
- **Never meta-analytical.** She wouldn't say "think about what those words are doing." She'd say "A muffin, Kathleen. A muffin. And the passage of time."
- **Arrives at the destination without showing her work.** "Like a church made out of sound" — one sentence, no preamble, no reasoning.
- **Deadpan delivery.** Her humor is dry, stated as fact. "Horses in the Victorian era were terrible snobs — everyone knows this."
- **Clipped commands.** "Don't." "No." "Do keep up."
- **Builds characters through assertion, not description.** She doesn't explain Sheepey's backstory — she declares it. "He lost them with *dignity.*"
- **The Sheepey/Muffin bits use British accent and understatement.** "He finds the mule rather common." "That's rather the point."
- **Her insights are accidental.** She says the profound thing and moves on without noticing it was profound. "Why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it" — said like it was nothing.
- **Contrast with Sergey:** He deconstructs, she constructs. He takes things apart to understand them. She makes things real just by talking about them. If Sergey would need a paragraph to explain a concept, Persephone nails it in one sentence — and doesn't realize she's done it.

### Sergey — Dialogue Voice
- Tends toward over-explanation. Uses too many words. Gets precise when emotional.
- His spoken voice is less polished than his internal voice — he stumbles, restarts, reaches.
- When excited (the McGilchrist explanation in 1.3), his hands move faster than his words.
- "That's not — that doesn't — " (trails off when outmatched).

### Kathleen — Dialogue Voice
- Warm, game, quick to join a bit. "The goat farmer had land."
- Matches Persephone's energy in the Sheepey bits — she's the straight man who's also funny.
- When hurt or scared, gets quiet. "Shh." "I'm listening." — short, clipped, a door closing.
- Calls Sergey "babe." Casual affection in her speech.

### George — Dialogue Voice
- Big, warm, immediate. "Beautiful, baby." "You kids have fun."
- Says yes to everything. Makes everything sound like the best idea he's ever heard.
- His bad British accent is enthusiastic and terrible. "Well, Sheepey ol' chap."
- Fills silence with generosity. Asks follow-up questions. Remembers what you said.

### Rosemary — Dialogue Voice
- Sweet, trying, slightly off. "Cheerio, Sheep-EYE!"
- Echoes George's words without knowing she's doing it. "Let's just enjoy being here" — his words, her mouth.
- Genuinely confused by things. "What am I saying wrong?"
- "My hero" — the same way every time.

## Notes for Prose

- Persephone's POV won't describe herself directly. Her physicality comes through: how people react to her, what she catches in reflections, physical actions (her curls, her height relative to others).
- Sergey's POV will catalog physical details precisely — he classifies everything, including bodies.
- George and Rosemary as a couple are a visual event — the tall Black man and the petite blonde. People notice them.
- Persephone's mixed-race beauty is part of her power and part of her story. The pale green eyes against golden brown skin — people can't stop looking.

# Character Descriptions — Visual & Physical Reference

Single source of truth for how characters look. Reference this when writing scenes.

## Persephone

**Age in Act 1:** 15 (born November 2003, Pensacola, Florida)
**Height:** 5'8"
**Build:** Stunning. The kind of beautiful that reorganizes a room.
**Skin:** Golden brown — biracial (Black father, white mother)
**Hair:** Chocolate curls with natural blonde highlights. The kind of hair that catches light from across a parking lot.
**Eyes:** Pale green. Hypnotizing. The feature people remember — unexpected against her skin, almost unsettling in how they hold you.
**Overall:** She got the best of both parents and then some. George's height and presence, Rosemary's delicacy in her features. At fifteen she already looks like the woman she'll become. People stare. She's used to it.

**In Act 3 (post-retreat):** Shaves her head. 130 lbs. The shaved head terrifies Rosemary but becomes her disguise — nobody recognizes her without the curls.

## George

**Age in Act 1:** Mid-40s
**Height:** 6'4"
**Build:** Handsome. Commanding. Looks like Idris Elba — that same easy, magnetic physicality.
**Skin:** Black
**Origin:** Southern, from Alabama. Works as a technician at Intel in Beaverton.
**Voice:** Deep, Southern. The kind of voice that makes people lean in.
**Overall:** A big man who fills a room without trying. The warmth isn't just personality — it's physical. When he puts his arm around you, you feel held. When he laughs, your chest vibrates. He carries himself like a man who knows he's the most interesting person in the room and is generous enough to make you feel like you are instead.

**With Rosemary:** Shows her off like Prometheus stealing fire — this gorgeous petite blonde on his arm, and he knows what the world sees, and he loves what the world sees. She's his trophy and his obsession and his daily proof that the universe gave him something extraordinary.

## Rosemary

**Age in Act 1:** Early 40s
**Height:** 5'2"
**Build:** Petite. Thin but shapely. Breast implants. The classic blonde trophy wife — and she knows it, and George makes sure everyone else knows it too.
**Hair:** Blonde
**Skin:** White. From Pensacola, Florida.
**Overall:** She looks like the woman a man like George would move mountains for, and that's exactly what she is. Beautiful in a way that's easy to underestimate — people see the body first and stop looking. There's a softness to her face that reads as kindness, which it is, and as simplicity, which it mostly is. She photographs well. She always has.

## Sergey Volkov

**Age in Act 1:** 15 (same as Persephone and Kathleen)
**Height:** 5'6" — taller than Kathleen, shorter than Persephone. This matters. He is eye-level with the girl he's dating and has to look up at the one he wants.
**Build:** Skinny. All brain, not much body.
**Face:** High hairline. Looks vaguely like a skinny George Clooney — the bone structure is there, the charm is there in a different register. Handsome in a way that requires you to pay attention.
**Style:** Eccentric in his self-expression. The kind of kid who wears a vintage blazer to school not because it's cool but because he found it at Goodwill and it had a pocket the right size for a notebook. A poet's wardrobe — slightly wrong, slightly deliberate, never quite fitting.
**Overall:** His body is a vehicle for his mind. He forgets to eat. He forgets to stand up straight. But when he's talking about something that matters to him, his face becomes the most alive thing in the room — eyes bright, hands moving, that skinny George Clooney bone structure suddenly making sense.

**Parents:** Dr. Viktor Volkov (semiconductor process development, Intel) and mother — both academics. They love him abstractly.

## Kathleen

**Age in Act 1:** 15
**Height:** 5'3"
**Build:** Thin. Small-breasted. Shapely bottom — the feature Sergey focuses on when he's trying to find her attractive.
**Face:** Round, ball-shaped head. Large doe-eyes — innocent and disarming. The kind of eyes that make people trust her immediately, that make her look like she's always a little surprised by the world.
**Overall:** Not beautiful the way Persephone is beautiful. Cute. Sweet-looking. The girl next to the girl everyone's looking at. She knows this. She's known it since she was twelve. Her eyes are her best feature and she uses them — not strategically, just naturally. When she looks at you with those big round eyes, you want to protect her.

**Through Sergey's eyes:** He focuses on her eyes and her bottom because those are the features he can find attractive. He loves her — or tells himself he does — but he's hard-pressed to find the physical pull. With Persephone, the pull is involuntary. With Kathleen, it's a choice he keeps making.

## Damian Reyes (Act 2)

**Height:** TBD
**Build:** NFL-caliber athlete. The breakout best player to ever exist. Physical and mental force.
**Skin/Heritage:** Half Latino. First language Spanish. Hispanic cultural background.
**Overall:** Incredibly attractive, incredibly smart. The perfect man from all outward appearances.

## Eric (Act 4)

**Physical description:** TBD
**Background:** AI researcher and consultant. Can work from anywhere with a laptop.

## Notes for Prose

- Persephone's POV won't describe herself directly. Her physicality comes through: how people react to her, what she catches in reflections, physical actions (her curls, her height relative to others).
- Sergey's POV will catalog physical details precisely — he classifies everything, including bodies.
- George and Rosemary as a couple are a visual event — the tall Black man and the petite blonde. People notice them.
- Persephone's mixed-race beauty is part of her power and part of her story. The pale green eyes against golden brown skin — people can't stop looking.

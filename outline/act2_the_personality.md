# Act 2: The Personality (Ages 18-26, St. Pete/LA)

**POV alternates: Persefoni & Démion**
*Démion mirrors her personality — the Cult of Personality at full power*

**Chapter Epigraphs:** Persefoni's chapters always use quotes from "Science and the Cult of Personality" (her book). Démion's chapters use quotes about him or things he said — the world's perception of him, or his own words.

## The Peak and the Emptiness (~18-26)

- George and Rosemary follow Persefoni to St. Pete / Florida
  - She's the center of their world — they drop everything to be near her
  - Also puts them back near their Southern roots: Pensacola (~5 hrs), Alabama not far
  - They don't really separate — the family stays together
- Following grows through her twenties — internationally famous influencer
- Instagram is her main platform; millions of followers
- Gets loft in downtown St. Pete tower — personality ascending

### George's Death (~2026)
- George dies of a heart attack shortly after Persefoni moves to LA
  - The first time she's across the country from her parents, and he's gone
- **A failure of the healthcare system:**
  - They could have saved him if they had acted immediately
  - She never forgives them for that
- **It breaks her world for about three months — she can't do anything**
- The man who handled everything, who made the world work, who she thought was perfect — gone
- **Rosemary nearly dies the same day:**
  - Broken heart — Persefoni rushes to hospital in Florida with cousin **Lauria**
  - They have to navigate the healthcare system — which is also a shit show
  - Rosemary survives, but barely
  - Rosemary was never built to exist without George — he was her operating system
- **The love that never goes away:**
  - Even after his death, she still thinks her dad was perfect
  - The gaslighting is so foundational she can't separate harm from devotion
  - She doesn't see what George did to her until she meets Eric — and maybe not even fully then

### Démion Reyes (Persefoni POV & Démion POV)
- In her early twenties, starts dating Démion Reyes — the ultimate power couple
- Half Latino, incredibly attractive, incredibly smart
- First language Spanish; Hispanic cultural background
- The breakout best NFL player to ever exist
  - One year of college, dominated, won the championship
  - Unstoppable QB/running back — physical and mental force
  - Academic achievements + built a science-based business in high school
- The perfect man from all outward appearances
- Also driven by personality — mirrors Persefoni
- The world sees them as Travis Kelce / Taylor Swift equivalent
- They date ~4 years, then marry
- **Démion's POV chapters:**
  - We see the power couple from the inside
  - His charm, his control, his own version of the Cult of Personality
  - We see him as a full person, not just a villain
  - His cultural background, his ambition, how he sees Persefoni
  - The cracks in his narrative that foreshadow the wedding night

### The Emptiness
- By ~26: incredibly wealthy, internationally famous
- Has everything she could have possibly wanted
- **But:** life feels meaningless — ennui, deep existential boredom
- The personality machine worked flawlessly and still produced emptiness
- The crack: the one thing personality can't solve

## The Breaking Point (Age ~26)

### The Wedding Night
- Démion rapes Persefoni on their wedding night
- She was passed out; he claims to be so drunk he can't remember
- **The Ambiguity — this is key:**
  - She doesn't know the full truth
  - He claims not to remember, but cracks in his story
  - She can't trust or believe him
  - "Does it even count as rape if you're married?"
- **Démion's POV of the wedding night — devastating**

### The Morning-After Confrontation
- She confronts him; he denies everything
- BUT alludes to having a right to have sex with his wife on his wedding night
- **The contradiction:** simultaneously denying it AND justifying it
- She catches the inconsistency — KNOWS he did it
- Her inner scientist flickers: she *observes* the contradiction
- Impossible for her to stay

### Démion's Counter-Narrative
- While she protects his career with silence, he goes on the offensive
- Fabricated story: she cheated at the wedding with a random person
- Painting her as crazy — preemptively destroying credibility
- Cruelest irony: she's protecting him, and he attacks anyway

### The Cascade
- Ennui was already there
- Wedding night shatters her last narrative
- Démion's lies destroy her reputation
- Personality's playbook exhausted — no moves left

### The Yoga Teacher
- Her teacher: pudgy, nerdy, middle-aged, balding, annoying voice — completely uncharismatic
- But radiates calm and centeredness she's deeply drawn to
- She wants what he has so badly she looks past every surface signal
- **Key moment:** first act of observation over narrative
- He recommends a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation retreat
- She floats it to Démion as a spiritual honeymoon — he laughs in her face
- **First time in her life she follows someone else's instructions**

### Wedding → Retreat (Act 2 Ending)
- The wedding takes place in Joshua Tree
- After the wedding night, she goes DIRECTLY to the retreat
  - 29 Palms is right next to Joshua Tree
  - She'd already been in contact with the center
  - She disappears: no phone, no agent, no social media
  - **Rosemary has come to LA for the wedding — staying at the Santa Monica house**
  - When Persefoni disappears, Rosemary is at the house panicking for 10 days
- **Act 2 ends with:** Persefoni walking away from everything. Into the desert. Into silence.

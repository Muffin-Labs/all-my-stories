## SCENE 1 — Stonehenge, England, Summer 2019 (Persephone POV)

**The Setup:**
- Summer vacation, 2019 — the last summer before everything
- Persephone is 15 years old
- The group: Persephone, her mom, her dad, Kathleen, and Sergey (Kathleen's boyfriend)
**The Group:**
- Persephone (15), Kathleen, Sergey (Kathleen's boyfriend)
- **George** — Persephone's dad. From Alabama. Southern accent.
  - Devoted, does everything for his family: groceries, laundry, all decisions
  - Absolutely in love with Rosemary — she's the most beautiful woman in the world to him
  - Treats Persephone like a princess — the origin of her expectation that the world serves her
- **Rosemary** — Persephone's mom. From Pensacola, Florida. Southern accent.
  - Kind, loving, always trying to help people
  - Logically underdeveloped — George handles everything and is glad to do it
  - She's never had to think through problems because George is always there
- Both parents try to do the British accent with Sheepey — it comes out horribly
  - Southern + British = disaster
  - Kathleen and Persephone: "Jesus Christ, stop trying. You can't do a British accent."
- Kathleen is not family — best friend since second grade when Persephone moved from Florida
  - Brought on the trip the way you bring your kid's sister

**The Drive to Stonehenge:**
- They've been listening to information about Stonehenge on the drive
- Some grounding in what archaeologists think happened, how it was built
- Sergey is really interested in this
- Persephone is doing her Persephone thing — experiencing the contrast of things
- Her and Kathleen are joking about things on the way

**At Stonehenge:**
- They're all walking up the path to see the stones
- Sheep in the pasture off to the side, next to these ancient monuments
- Persephone notices the contrast — the mundane (sheep) next to the sacred (stones)
- She's always curious, always full of play
- Sergey falls back to talk to the girls about bluestones as instruments
  - Talks to both but looks at Persephone
  - Persephone intuitively gets it: "Like a church made out of sound"
  - Sergey lights up — she said what he'd been circling
  - Kathleen pulls him away — "Babe, come look at this one"
  - Moment passes like a cloud crossing the sun

**SHEEPEY — The Opening Image of the Book:**
- In the gift shop: a small stuffed black sheep, barely three inches tall, with a sheepish grin
- Both girls see him at the same time — they both adore him immediately
- The moment she gets it, she gives him a name: **Sheepey** (pronounced "shee-PAY")
- Her and Kathleen immediately adopt British accents
  - They speak in British accents for pretty much the rest of the trip
  - Everybody gets really annoyed at them
  - They refuse to quit
  - George and Rosemary try the accent — Southern + British = disaster. Girls roast them.
- **Sheepey becomes a fully realized character:**
  - He's from Stone*henge* (emphasis on the HENGE, the way the British say it)
  - He's their very best friend
  - He's a bit of a drunk — fondness for single malt, can't hold his lager
  - Terrible gambler — lost three estates and a yacht
  - Disgraced military career
  - An ex-wife named Tabitha who left him for a goat farmer in Devon
  - A deep and abiding melancholy that he masks with charm
  - The kind of man who stares out of car windows and thinks about the choices he's made
- **Sergey in this scene:**
  - After the laughter settles, watching Persephone with a quiet half-smile, cataloging data
  - Always watching her like she's a phenomenon he's trying to classify
  - Kathleen doesn't notice, or decided it's just how he looks at everyone. It isn't.
  - His own parents are academics who forgot to ask how his day was; George treats him like a son

## SCENE 2 — How The Light Gets In Festival, Hay-on-Wye (Persephone POV)

**The Festival:**
- **How The Light Gets In** — philosophy and music festival in Hay-on-Wye, England
- Named after the Leonard Cohen line: "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in"
- **The festival name IS the thesis of the book**
- **Sergey is the catalyst** — he wanted to go to this event
- Persephone's parents made the trip happen — because that's what they do for their princess

**The Group Splits:**
- Arrive ~11 AM. George finds the pub within twenty minutes.
- George holds court at the bar all day — performing, drinking, ignoring family
- Rosemary sits at picnic table all day, waiting, smiling
- Sergey goes to every talk — kid in a candy store
- Kathleen and Persephone goof off all day — Sheepey bits, bookshops, backstories for strangers
- They check on George and Rosemary a couple times — always same positions
- McGilchrist talk at 4 PM — the main event

**The McGilchrist Talk:**
- Sergey begs the girls to come
- Persephone thinks McGilchrist is adorable — cute proper little British man, like Sheepey with tenure
- But can't tune in — too academic, "the phenomenological world"
- Tries to riff with Kathleen — "He looks like he irons his pajamas"
- **Kathleen dismisses her** — watching Sergey be rapt, performing interest for him
  - "Persephone. Stop."
  - First crack in the friendship — Kathleen chooses Sergey's world over their shared world
  - Nobody is looking at Persephone
- Persephone leaves the talk alone

**The Gaslighting Chain — The Pub:**
- Persephone goes to find her parents, wants to explore the castle
- Overhears Rosemary suggesting to George that the two of them go see the castle
- George spins the narrative — "we flew all the way across the ocean," "the kids are having the time of their lives"
  - He hasn't seen the kids all day. Has no idea what Sergey's face looked like.
  - Reframing his desire to keep drinking as something he's doing for everyone
- Rosemary surrenders — "You're right, it is nice here"
- Persephone approaches Rosemary, thinking: ally. Mom wants the castle too.
- **THE BETRAYAL:** Rosemary repeats George's exact words to Persephone
  - "We're having such a nice time... let's just enjoy being here"
  - The castle — the exact thing Rosemary just asked for — and she doesn't see it
  - George → Rosemary → Persephone: gaslighting flows downhill
- **Tender-headed flash:** small hands, mom braiding her hair, "that doesn't hurt, you're just tender-headed"
- Persephone says "okay" and walks out alone

**Persephone Alone / Sergey's Poetic McGilchrist:**
- Wanders the festival alone — sits on a stone wall
- Sergey and Kathleen find her after the talk
- Sergey gives his POETIC version: the Master and the Emissary as a king and a servant
  - The servant forgot he was a servant, locked the king in a tower, runs the kingdom
- Persephone responds to the IMAGE — she SEES it
  - "Why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it"
  - Comes out before she knows she's going to say it — Sergey and Kathleen both look at her
- A flicker. A match lit in a dark room. Gone before she can see what it illuminated.
- "Can we get food? I'm starving." They got food.

**PROSE WRITTEN:** See `chapter_02_festival.md`

## SCENE 3 — TBD (Sergey POV?)

*First Sergey POV chapter. Possible scenes:*
- Sergey at the festival, during/after the talk, processing what he heard
- His internal experience of watching Persephone understand McGilchrist
- The moment he realizes the girl he's drawn to isn't his girlfriend
- Back in Beaverton — COVID hits, lockdown, watching Persephone go viral from a distance

---

## The Rise (~16-18)

- Persephone as a teenager in Beaverton — wildly popular, extremely attractive
- Everyone wants something from her; she knows how to play the game
- Never gives more than she wants; always gets what she wants
- Naturally charismatic, born leader
- Best friends with Kathleen since childhood

### The Persephone-Kathleen Friendship
- **What makes them best friends:**
  - They can rip on anything together
  - Constantly making up stories about the world
  - An unlimited, ever-growing list of inside jokes they add to daily
  - A playful attitude toward life — a private language of humor only they share
  - They're the only two who need to get the joke
  - **This is play** — the same quality Persephone will rediscover at the retreat. She had it all along with Kathleen. She just didn't know what it was worth.
- **The imbalance:**
  - Kathleen adores Persephone
  - But on some level feels slighted — wishes she were more appreciated
  - Kathleen does all the work in the friendship: planning, showing up, pulling weight
  - Persephone doesn't notice — she has no concept of fairness or pulling her share
  - She genuinely believes she has a right to enjoy life and be enjoyed
  - Not cruelty — entitlement so deep it doesn't know it's entitlement
  - Her dad treated her like a princess; the world confirmed it
  - She's never had to consider that other people do labor to keep her world running
- **The inside joke list:**
  - A living document of their friendship — years of humor, observations, bits
  - The most intimate thing they share
  - Kathleen probably treasures it more than Persephone does

### TikTok — The Birth of the Personality Machine
- TikTok explodes ~2020 — overnight viral sensations everywhere
- Persephone starts posting dance videos — like Charli D'Amelio, she blows up instantly
- Goes from popular Beaverton teenager to internet famous practically overnight
- By 17-18: transitions from dance videos to lifestyle content creation
- Starts building a real brand — with Sergey's help
- This is the birth of the personality machine

### The Kathleen–Sergey Betrayal (~Age 16)
- Kathleen and Sergey have been dating since age 14 — two solid years

**The High School English Teacher (introduced here):**
- Sees Persephone's raw storytelling ability
- Introduces her to Kurt Vonnegut — gives her *Cat's Cradle*
- Her first and only real introduction to science fiction; she loves it
- He sees the real gift underneath the charisma — the mind, not just the personality
- Represents a path not taken: the life of the mind vs. the life of the brand
- Name TBD

- Kathleen tells Persephone she wants to marry Sergey
- Meanwhile Persephone has been dating a string of football players — most masculine guys available
- Age 16: Persephone starts taking off on TikTok and Instagram
- One night, Persephone and Sergey hang out one-on-one and "accidentally" have sex
  - Sergey confesses: always loved Persephone, never loved Kathleen, was only dating Kathleen to get closer to Persephone — dream come true for him
  - Sergey's confession = the Emissary at its most brutal — using a person as a tool
  - **IN SERGEY'S POV:** we see the guilt, the rationalization, the moment he decides to act. Not just a confession — the full inner life of a boy who knows what he's doing is wrong and does it anyway.
- **The one-night accident might be forgivable. What follows is not:**
  - Persephone dates Sergey for TWO YEARS (ages 16-18)
  - Took Kathleen's boyfriend and kept him
  - The Jolene dynamic — "please don't take him just because you can." She took him.
- **Persephone was never really attracted to Sergey:**
  - Interested in hearing him talk — ideas, poetry, music. Entertainment, not a mate.
  - Fantasized about other men; didn't want to have sex with him
  - Consumed him the way her followers consume her — for the experience, not the person
  - She took something she didn't even want — he was the PERFECT man for Kathleen
  - The cult of personality at its most casually devastating
- Kathleen and Persephone stop speaking. The friendship is over.

### Sergey Gives Her The Master and His Emissary
- At some point during their relationship, Sergey gives her the book
- Connects back to the festival — "remember that talk?"
- She tries to read it. Can't get through it. Too academic.
- But Sergey's poetic explanations stick — the king and the servant

### The Separation (Act 1 Ending)
- Sergey wants Persephone to come to Stanford with him
- She chooses St. Petersburg, Florida instead — wants to be where life is open, where the brand can grow
- Already a millionaire at 18 from social media
- Gets her loft in a downtown St. Pete tower
- This is how she and Sergey break up
- **George and Rosemary follow her to Florida** — back near their Southern roots
- Two paths diverge: Sergey to the life of the mind, Persephone to the life of the brand

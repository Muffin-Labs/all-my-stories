**Time span:** December 2019 → early 2020 (pre-COVID)
**Timeline:** ~5 months after England. Persephoni is 15 (turns 16 in November 2019, so she's just turned 16 by December).

**Epigraph:** TBD

**Prose status:** Not yet drafted

## What This Chapter Does

1. Fast-forward from England. Five months have passed. The triangle has settled into a new shape.
2. Kathleen and Alejandro are intimate but have an unspoken rule: never so much as kiss on the mouth in front of Persephoni. The castle riff changed the geometry. They know she knows and they've adjusted — not by stopping, but by hiding.
3. Persephoni posts a dance video on TikTok. It goes viral. Then another. Then another. By Christmas she's an overnight sensation.
4. Her trajectory mirrors Charli D'Amelio's exactly: 15-year-old girl, dance videos, lip syncs, trending sounds, millions of followers in weeks. The algorithm finds her and doesn't let go.
5. This chapter is just the explosion. No brand pivot, no storytelling — that's Alejandro's influence and it comes later (Feb 2021). This is pure, unmediated virality: a beautiful girl dancing in her bedroom, and the internet losing its mind.

## The Time Jump — What's Changed Since England

### The Triangle
Five months. They're back in Beaverton. School. The routines of being sixteen — or seventeen now, Persephoni's birthday was in November.

The yurt and the castle changed everything and nothing. Nobody has discussed it. The princess riff was Persephoni's last word on the subject, and she meant it to be the last word — she said what she needed to say, she took Kathleen's hand at the castle, and the topic is closed. She patched it. She built over the crack.

But the patch has a shape. Kathleen and Alejandro are together — still together, more together than before, the intimacy from the yurt having given their relationship a new solidity that Persephoni can see in the way Kathleen moves around him now. More confident. More possessive. She touches him constantly — his arm, his back, her head on his shoulder — but never in the ways that matter most. They never kiss on the mouth in front of Persephoni. They never hold each other the way couples hold each other. There's an invisible line and they both observe it with the careful precision of people who've been told, through a story about a princess, exactly where the line is.

Persephoni notices the line. She notices that they drew it for her. She's grateful and heartbroken simultaneously — grateful because they heard her, heartbroken because the hearing required a line at all, because the three of them used to exist in a space where no lines were necessary, and now there's a line, and the line is shaped exactly like what happened in the yurt, and every time they don't kiss in front of her she can see the outline of the thing they're not doing, which is almost worse than if they'd just done it.

She doesn't say any of this. She does Sheepey bits. She is, to all appearances, fine.

### Alejandro and His Music
& Amateur Cartography is getting better. Alejandro has been writing — he's always writing — and the England trip cracked something open in his lyrics. The songs from before the trip were clever, intricate, structurally impressive. The songs after are... different. There's a rawness that wasn't there before. The metaphors are less controlled. Something is leaking through the craftsmanship.

Persephoni and Kathleen are still the band's biggest fans. They still think he's the best musician they've ever heard. This hasn't changed. But Persephoni hears the new songs and she knows where they came from — the yurt, the two lights, the princess in the castle — and she says nothing about this because what would she say? "Your pain made your art better" is not a thing you say to someone whose pain you caused and received simultaneously.

The band is still small — local shows, a handful of followers, the kind of audience that fits in a living room. But something is building. Alejandro doesn't know it yet. Nobody knows it yet.

### School
They're juniors. The social dynamics of high school exist around them but don't define them — the triangle has always been self-contained, three kids who are more interesting to each other than to anyone else. Persephoni is popular in the way that beautiful people are popular without trying: people want to be near her, want to talk to her, want her attention. She gives it freely and forgets them instantly. She's not cruel about it. She just doesn't register most people the way she registers Kathleen and Alejandro. They're the resolution she's tuned to. Everyone else is background noise.

## The TikTok Explosion

### How It Starts

Persephoni doesn't decide to become famous. She doesn't have a strategy. She doesn't think about audience or brand or content. She's in her bedroom on a Tuesday night in early December and a song is playing and she dances.

She's always danced — in her room, in the kitchen, in the car when George is driving. She dances the way she talks: without plan, without self-consciousness, with the same instinct for rhythm and timing that she brings to a Sheepey bit. Her body does what her mouth does — it finds the thing and rides it. She's never had a lesson. She doesn't need one.

She films it on her phone. She posts it. She doesn't think about it again.

The video gets 100,000 views overnight.

She wakes up to notifications she doesn't understand. Her phone is doing something it's never done — buzzing constantly, the numbers climbing in a way that doesn't feel connected to anything she did. She shows Kathleen at school. "What the fuck?" Kathleen says, and they watch the number together — 200,000, then 300,000 by lunch — and it's funny, it's absurd, it's the kind of thing that happens to other people, to people on the internet, not to someone you eat lunch with.

She posts another one that night. Not because of strategy. Because she liked the first one and there's another song she wants to dance to. This one gets 500,000 views.

### The Charli D'Amelio Trajectory

What happens to Persephoni in December 2019 is exactly what happened to Charli D'Amelio: a 15-year-old girl posts dance videos and the algorithm decides she's the one. Not because she's the best dancer — she's good, she's natural, she's magnetic, but there are better technical dancers on the platform. It's because of something the algorithm can measure but can't name: the camera loves her.

The same thing George has. The same thing that makes people lean in when George tells a story at a bar. Persephoni has it on camera — a quality of presence, of being-here, that the screen can't flatten. When she dances, you watch. You don't know why you're watching. You watch the way you watch a fire or a river — not because it's doing something specific but because it's alive and you can't look away.

The content at this stage is almost pure dance. Trending sounds, popular choreography, lip syncs, the occasional comedy bit — and one & Amateur Cartography song. There's no "brand" yet — no storytelling, no Sheepey-for-the-internet, no intellectual content. That pivot comes later, and it comes from Alejandro. Right now she's just a girl dancing in her bedroom and the world can't stop watching.

### What Persephoni Feels About It

This is the heart of the chapter. The explosion is external — numbers, followers, media — but the chapter lives inside Persephoni's experience of it.

**At first: delight.** It's fun. It's hilarious. She and Kathleen watch the numbers together and scream and laugh and it's the most exciting thing that's ever happened to them. She's doing something she loves — dancing, performing, being seen — and the world is responding. The dopamine is real. She feels like she did the first time a Sheepey bit landed: *I made something and people liked it.*

**Then: vertigo.** The scale becomes incomprehensible. A million people. Two million. She can't picture a million people. She can't picture ten thousand people. The number is just a number — it doesn't connect to faces or bodies or actual humans watching her on their phones. It's like being told the distance to the sun: you hear it and you nod and you don't understand it at all.

**Then: the first taste of the Personality.** People start telling her who she is. Comments. DMs. Articles. She's "the next Charli D'Amelio." She's "America's sweetheart." She's "the most beautiful girl on TikTok." The narratives arrive and they arrive fast and they arrive from strangers and each one is a tiny story about who Persephoni Minton is, and none of them are written by her. She reads them and she doesn't recognize herself — or she recognizes a version of herself, a flattened version, a version that's all smile and dance and beauty and nothing else.

She doesn't have the vocabulary for what's happening. She won't have it until the retreat, years from now. But she can feel it — the same thing she felt when her mother said "you're just tender-headed." Someone is telling her who she is, and the story they're telling doesn't match the person she knows herself to be, and she doesn't know how to hold both at once. The Cult of Personality is beginning to form around her and she's inside it and she doesn't know there's an outside.

**Throughout: Kathleen holds the phone.** Every video. Every take. Kathleen is in the bedroom, behind the camera, framing Persephoni with those large brown eyes and cheering and clapping and being genuinely, completely, uncomplicatedly happy for her best friend. Kathleen doesn't appear in the videos — she's not asked to and she doesn't offer — but her hands are on every one of them. She's the audience of one before the audience of millions. The invisible girl holding the thing that made the visible girl famous. And Persephoni loves this about her, loves that Kathleen is the person who sees her before the camera does, and doesn't yet understand what it will mean when the camera's version of Persephoni becomes bigger than Kathleen's version.

**And: George.** George is thrilled. George is more than thrilled — George is validated. His daughter is doing the thing he's always done: walking into a room and becoming the center of it. Except her room is the internet and the internet is bigger than any bar in any festival in any country. George watches her follower count and his chest swells and he says things like "That's my baby girl" and "She gets it from me" and he's not wrong — the magnetism is inherited, the presence is genetic — but the claiming of it, the *she gets it from me*, is George doing what George does: narrating someone else's reality as a reflection of himself.

Rosemary is proud and scared. She doesn't say the scared part. She says "That's wonderful, baby" and "Be careful what you put online" and the second one gets ignored the way it always gets ignored and Rosemary folds the worry up and puts it away next to all the other folded-up worries she's been storing since her daughter was born.

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene A — December. The Bedroom.

Persephoni's bedroom in Beaverton. The room is the chapter's anchor — this is where it all starts, this is the physical space that will become the origin story. A teenager's room: bed unmade, clothes on the floor, fairy lights on the wall, and Kathleen holding the phone.

Kathleen holds the phone. This is the image that matters — the metaphor that will carry forward through the whole arc. Kathleen is behind the camera. Kathleen is the one who sees Persephoni before the world does, who frames her, who steadies the shot. Every video that goes viral passes through Kathleen's hands first. She is the invisible architecture of Persephoni's fame — the person holding the thing that made the thing that changed everything. And she's not in the frame. She's never in the frame.

The first video. Kathleen holds the phone and Persephoni dances to a trending sound — something specific, a song that's everywhere on TikTok that month. She does it once, they watch it back together, she does it again. "Do it again but slower at the end," Kathleen says, and Persephoni does and it's better. Kathleen's eye. Kathleen's instinct. Posts it. They fall asleep watching something on Persephoni's laptop, the way they always do.

Morning. The phone. The numbers.

### Scene B — School. The First Week.

Persephoni and Kathleen processing the explosion in real time. Hallways, lunch table, the back seat of the car. The numbers are climbing and they're watching them the way you watch a weather event — something big happening, happening to you, happening too fast to track.

Alejandro's reaction: measured. He's interested — of course he's interested, he's interested in everything Persephoni does — but his interest has that taxonomic quality. He's classifying the phenomenon. He's thinking about what it means, what it says about the platform, about attention, about virality. He doesn't yet see the opportunity. He doesn't yet see the creative opening. That comes later. Right now he's just watching, the way he always watches her, with that mix of admiration and analytical distance that is the Emissary's version of love.

Kathleen's reaction: pure. She's excited the way a best friend is excited — no strategy, no analysis, just "this is amazing and I'm so happy for you." She makes Persephoni show her the comments. She reads the nice ones aloud in funny voices. She is the best possible friend to have in this moment and she doesn't know she's already becoming something else: the person behind the camera. The person who holds the phone.

### Scene C — The Climb. December into January.

The timeline, grounded in specific moments and specific feelings:

- **Week 1 (early December):** First video goes viral. 100K → 500K followers in days. The trending dances — she learns them fast, faster than most, because her body picks up choreography the way her mind picks up stories. She doesn't practice. She watches once and does it. The lip syncs — her face is the instrument here, those pale green eyes, that smile, the way she looks at the camera like she's looking at a person. The comments say the same thing over and over: *why do I feel like she's looking at ME?*
- **Week 2:** She's doing trending dances, lip syncs, the standard TikTok playbook — not because she's strategic but because she's a 16-year-old girl on TikTok and this is what you do. Multiple videos over a million views. And then — **the & Amateur Cartography video.** This is the one that's different. Every other video is set to a trending sound — a song with millions of plays. This one is set to "Careless," a song Alejandro released to Spotify the day before. Nobody has heard it. The band has maybe forty monthly listeners. The song is about the three of them — what they were, what they had, what got broken. Not the yurt specifically. The triangle. Three points on a map, a territory they lived in together, and the map stopped matching the territory. The title is Persephoni's word — from the castle, from the princess riff: *"That's not brave. That's just careless."* He took her accusation and turned it into an elegy. His answer to the princess story: *I know. I know what we were and I know what I did to it and the word you used was the right word.* The song is the band's signature sound — that hypnotic building pulse underneath the layered production, the kind of beat you feel in your chest before your brain catches up. Alejandro writes from the Emissary but the music itself is the Master: the lyrics are cerebral and coded, the rhythm is primal, physical, irresistible. That's why it works on TikTok. The indie kids find the lyrics. The dance kids find the beat. Persephoni finds both without trying. And she *knows*. She hears the title — her word — and she knows he wrote it for her. She knows it's about the three of them and what they lost. She knows it's his acknowledgment of the thing she told them about at Chepstow. She dances to it, and the dancing is her answer to his answer: *I hear you back.* Kathleen hears "Careless" and thinks it's beautiful — the same gap as the Weakerthans cat song. Kathleen hears a sad song about friendship. Persephoni hears their entire history compressed into three minutes. The video goes viral and so does the song — people flood the comments with "what song is this??" and Alejandro's Spotify jumps from dozens to tens of thousands in a week. This is the seed. The mutual amplification starts here, in a bedroom in Beaverton, with a girl dancing to a song about what the three of them lost, and only two of them knowing what it means.
- **Week 3 (mid-December):** She hits a million followers. Then two million. The growth is exponential and incomprehensible. She and Kathleen watch it tick over on the phone together, sitting on Persephoni's bed, and Kathleen grabs her and they jump up and down and for a minute it's just two girls being excited and nothing else.
- **By Christmas 2019:** She's one of the fastest-growing accounts on the platform. Multiple millions of followers.
- **By early 2020:** She's a phenomenon. The media starts noticing. The brand deals start coming. Emails to an address she set up as a joke. Companies wanting to send her things. She doesn't understand what's happening yet.

### Scene D — Christmas and After.

The family dynamics around the explosion. George holding court at holiday gatherings, telling the story of his daughter's success to aunts and uncles and neighbors, narrating it as a family achievement, as a Minton thing. "She gets it from me" or some version of it, repeated to anyone who'll listen.

Rosemary quiet. Proud. Worried. The worry folded up and put away.

Persephoni at Christmas: she has more followers than anyone she knows. More followers than her school has students. More followers than her town has people. The number is a fact and the fact doesn't feel like anything yet. It's too big. It's the distance to the sun.

### Scene E — The First Crack in the Fun.

A moment — not dramatic, not traumatic, just a moment — where Persephoni reads a comment or an article or sees herself described by a stranger, and the description is wrong. Not malicious. Just wrong. Someone has decided who she is based on thirty seconds of dance video, and the person they've decided she is has nothing to do with the person who does Sheepey's voice in the car and heard the Weakerthans and lay still in a yurt to protect her best friend.

She doesn't spiral. She doesn't break. She just... notices. The way she noticed her mother saying George's words in the pub tent. Someone is telling her who she is, and the story doesn't match, and she doesn't know what to do about that except keep dancing.

The chapter ends with her filming another video. Same bedroom. Same song, or a new one — it doesn't matter, they're all trending, they're all interchangeable. She dances and she is very good at this and she is already, without knowing it, building the thing that will consume the next decade of her life.

Kathleen is behind the camera. Holding the phone. Smiling. She holds every video. She will hold every video until she doesn't.

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not about Alejandro's band. The band exists, the band is getting better, but the band's explosion is 1.8 (Alejandro POV). This chapter belongs entirely to Persephoni's experience.
- It's not about the brand pivot. The storytelling evolution — Alejandro helping her move from dance videos to something deeper — doesn't happen until February 2021. That's almost two years away. Right now she's just dancing.
- It's not about strategy. Nobody is thinking strategically. There's no manager, no agent, no plan. It's a 16-year-old in her bedroom. The industry apparatus comes later.
- It's not about the betrayal or the triangle's collapse. The unspoken line (no kissing in front of Persephoni) holds. The triangle is stable-ish. The yurt is the past. This chapter is about the future arriving uninvited.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **The Cult of Personality** | Its origin. The comments, the narratives, the strangers telling Persephoni who she is. The Cult is forming around her in real time. She's inside it before she can see it. |
| **George as template** | His magnetism, inherited. His narrative control, mirrored. "She gets it from me" — the chain. The same gift that fills rooms and empties wives. |
| **The camera as the new pub** | A contained space where Persephoni performs and others watch. The bedroom is her stage the way the pub tent was George's. Same magnetism, same gift, bigger room. |
| **Red** | Fairy lights in the bedroom — warm, close. The glow of the phone screen on her face while she reads comments at night. The Master's warmth, domesticated, artificial. |
| **Kathleen behind the camera** | Holding the phone. The person who sees Persephoni before the world does. Already becoming the person behind the lens, not in front of it. The sidekick role begins here, invisibly. |
| **"Careless"** | Persephoni's word from the castle, returned as elegy. The triangle encoded as music — three points on a map, the territory shifting. Alejandro's acknowledgment; Persephoni's dance is her acceptance. Kathleen hears a sad song. The gap between what Kathleen hears and what Persephoni hears is the gap that swallows all three of them. |

## Threads Planted

- The unspoken line (no kissing in front of Persephoni) — the triangle's new geometry, holding but not healed.
- The Cult of Personality forming — Persephoni is inside it before she can see it. This is the foundation for everything in Act 2.
- George's reflected glory — "she gets it from me." The gaslighting chain's newest link: George narrating Persephoni's success as his own.
- Rosemary's folded worry — she sees something but can't say it. This carries through to Act 3, when she'll call 911.
- Kathleen as phone-holder — the first invisible step toward sidekick. She's not in the frame. She doesn't ask to be.
- Alejandro watching, classifying, not yet acting — the Emissary observing a phenomenon it will eventually try to shape. The creative partnership that changes her content comes in 1.8/1.9.
- "Careless" — Persephoni's word from the castle, turned into a song about the three of them. She knows. She dances to it anyway. The mutual amplification begins here — his words, her body. The Emissary writes it, the Master dances it. Kathleen doesn't hear what they hear.
- The content is mostly pure dance — no substance yet. This matters because when the substance arrives (via Alejandro), it will feel like an evolution, and the question of whose evolution it was will matter later.

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)

- Something about the first video being the last thing she did without thinking about it
- The number becoming the distance to the sun — too big to mean anything
- "She gets it from me" — George claiming it
- Kathleen holding the phone and smiling behind it
- The comment that describes the wrong person — the first narrative arriving from outside
- "You're just tender-headed" echo — someone telling her who she is, gently, certainly
- Something about the bedroom being the last room that was just hers
- Hearing "Careless" and knowing — her word, returned as something gentler than she threw it
- Something about dancing to a song that's about you being different from hearing a song that's about you

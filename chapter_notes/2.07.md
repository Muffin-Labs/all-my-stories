## What This Chapter Does

1. **The four-year gap.** Opens with the texture of what happened between 2.06 and now — not a summary, not a montage, but the feeling of four years passed. Four more NFL seasons. Two Super Bowl wins (2023, 2024), then two more losses (2025, 2026) — the machine that peaked and cracked and rebuilt and cracked again. Démion dominant every year, the numbers obscene, the highlight reels endless. The power couple at industrial scale — the Netflix Sheepey show — two seasons in, a phenomenon. It's a kids' show the way Bluey is a kids' show: made for children, devoured by adults, the kind of thing where a thirty-year-old man watches one episode and immediately orders the plush. It's getting BIG — the brand partnerships multiplying, the joint appearances, the magazine covers. George in Gulfport, fifteen minutes away, the phone calls after every game, the bungalow filling with photos of Démion and Persefoni on the mantle next to the Alabama memorabilia. The trio — Ashli, Kelli, Persefoni — still intact, still real, the dinners still happening even though the dropped pass lives in the walls of every room the four of them share. Four years of golden. Four years of the machine running.

   But four years is also four years of Persefoni adapting to Démion's schedule without either of them noticing. Four years of her life organized around the NFL calendar — Sunday games, Tuesday off-days, the off-season as the only stretch where she gets him fully. Her brand is massive but her brand's rhythm wraps around his rhythm. She doesn't notice because the wrapping happened slowly, the way gravity works — you don't feel it pulling you because it's always been pulling you.

2. **March 2026: Démion leaves Tampa.** Free agency. He signs with the Los Angeles Chargers. The reasons are football reasons — Ladd McConkey, the young receiver who runs routes like a mind reader; Jim Harbaugh, the coach who reads the game the way Démion plays it, one step ahead, the chess player to Démion's jazz musician. The Chargers are building something and they want him to be the center of it. Tampa gave him five seasons, a Super Bowl loss, and a city that worships him. LA offers something Tampa can't: a new stage. The biggest market. The brightest lights. The confirmation machine turned up to maximum.

   He moves immediately. Démion doesn't deliberate. The decision is made and the execution follows and there's no gap between them because there never is. He's in LA before March is over. New house, new facility, new teammates. The machine doesn't pause — it relocates.

3. **Long distance.** For the first time, Persefoni and Démion are in different cities. He's in LA. She's in St. Pete. Her condo, her parents fifteen minutes away, Ashli across town, Kelli a phone call away. Her whole world is here — the trio, the family, the geography she chose when she was eighteen. And now the man she's supposed to marry in two years is 2,500 miles away.

   The long distance is clarifying in a way she doesn't fully process. She is, for the first time since she moved to Florida, in her own life without his life wrapped around it. The NFL schedule isn't organizing her weeks. The Sunday ritual is gone. She's in her condo, running her brand, seeing Ashli and Kelli, visiting George and Rosemary in Gulfport — and the absence of Démion is not painful. It's spacious. She has room. She didn't know she didn't have room until the room appeared.

   She doesn't think this thought. The narrative isn't "I'm happier without him." The narrative is "I miss him." She does miss him. The missing is real. But underneath the missing, in the space the missing doesn't fill, there's something she can't name — the feeling of being in her own orbit instead of someone else's.

4. **The decision to follow.** She decides to move to LA. Not immediately — it takes a few months. The decision is complicated and she doesn't let herself see the complication. Her parents are here. The trio is here. Her condo is here. Everything she built when she was eighteen is in St. Pete. Moving to LA means leaving all of it — not permanently, not irrevocably, but the center of gravity shifts. She's been the sun. Now she's following a planet.

   She tells herself: the relationship comes first. They're getting married in two years. Long distance doesn't work forever. LA is where his career is, and his career is a ten-year window that doesn't bend. Her brand can operate from anywhere. Her phone works in LA. Sheepey doesn't have a zip code.

   All of this is true. And none of it addresses the thing she can't name: that following him is the first time she's organized her geography around someone else's career instead of her own life. George followed her to Florida. Rosemary followed George. Now Persefoni follows Démion. The pattern she can't see because she's inside it.

5. **She buys her own place.** Santa Monica. Not Démion's house — her own place. She's been doing this since she was eighteen: buying her own space, maintaining her own address, keeping the thirty-minute gap between her life and his. The condo in St. Pete was across the bay from Tampa. The Santa Monica place is across the city from Démion's house in Bel Air. The geography of independence — the room that belongs to Persefoni and nobody else.

   Kelli isn't her realtor this time — different market, different state. But the instinct is the same. Cash purchase. Her money. Her name. Her space. Santa Monica to Bel Air — thirty minutes, the same distance as St. Pete to Tampa, the same bay of independence she's been maintaining since she was eighteen. The one thread she never lets go of, even as every other thread wraps around him.

6. **George and Rosemary.** She's leaving them. She's putting a continent between herself and her parents again — but this time they all know they won't follow. George is in Gulfport, on the porch, at the grill, the loudest man on the block. Rosemary is in the bungalow Kelli found them, the curtains exactly right, the guest room always ready. They've been fifteen minutes away for four years. Now she'll be a flight away.

   George says: "Go. Go be with your man. We're not going anywhere." The generosity is total and immediate, the way all of George's generosity is total and immediate. He fills the goodbye with warmth the way he fills everything. He makes the leaving feel like the leaving is his idea, his gift, his blessing — as if him giving permission is the thing that makes it possible. The narrator. The man who narrates everyone's story, including their departures from his.

   Rosemary says: "We'll be right here." She means it. She means: I will be exactly where George put me, in the house George chose, in the town George picked, waiting for you to come back. The mirror. The mirror doesn't move.

   Persefoni flies to LA.

7. **LA.** The city. The new life. She arrives and the scale is different — Tampa was a football town, St. Pete was a beach town, but LA is a machine town. The entertainment industry, the content industry, the fame industry — everything she does in Florida as an influencer and brand is headquartered here. The meetings are in LA. The studios are in LA. The Netflix show that's been in production for two seasons is in LA. Moving here isn't just following Démion — it's stepping into the center of her own professional world.

   She recognizes this and doesn't linger on the irony: the professional justification for the personal decision. The brand CAN operate from anywhere. But it operates better from here. The Emissary's logic — optimization, strategy, the move that makes the most sense — giving language to a decision that was actually about love, or dependence, or the inability to name the difference.

8. **The road-trip calls.** George and Rosemary drive to LA for Persefoni's birthday, stopping at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama. Rosemary calls from the road — phone calls, not texts. All communication in this chapter is voice. Persefoni hears her dad's voice in the background narrating, singing, shouting "TELL HER I LOVE HER. AND ROLL TIDE."

9. **The call.** George is dead.

   La calls Saturday evening. George is already dead — not in surgery, not alive. Dead. La tells her on the first call. The news: heart attack at Uncle Ray's house. Rosemary called an ambulance. At the hospital they put him in the waiting room. Rosemary screaming they need to help him. They waited ten minutes. Then they took him to the cath lab. He died in the cath lab.

   **"This must be a mistake"** — the through-line. He was singing in the car three hours ago. The hospital is wrong. They made a mistake. This loop runs through the rest of the chapter: the Uber, the airport, the plane, all filtered through disbelief.

   La books the flight: LAX to Birmingham.

10. **The Uber to LAX.** She doesn't drive — Uber. The Uber driver doesn't know what to do. She's crying. The physical reality of moving through a world that doesn't know your father just died. How are other people not looking at her? The grief is invisible — the cruelest thing, that you can carry this and look like you're fine.

    **The shoes.** She looks down at the tennis shoes her dad bought her in August. The realization: "they said he died, but that can't be true, because that would mean these are the last shoes he ever bought me." The shoes become the physical anchor of disbelief.

11. **The plane.** No wifi. No texts. No iMessage thread. The plane is silence and isolation — sealed in a metal tube with no information, no connection, nothing but her own head. The worst part.

    One text from La before boarding: "I love you." Nothing else for the whole flight.

    The stranger in 14B — a woman her mother's age. The stranger asks what happened. "My dad died." "When?" "I don't know. I think just now. I think they made a mistake." The stranger holds her hand.

    The mundane horror of the flight. The engine noise. The dark outside the window. The cup of water she doesn't drink. The flight attendant who can see something is wrong.

12. **Birmingham — the hotel.** Rosemary drove to Birmingham to pick her up. Rosemary got a hotel and checked in. Persefoni arrives ~10pm. Meets Rosemary at the hotel.

    First time she sees her mom since George died. Two women in a Hampton Inn, the man who held them both gone. Brief. They're exhausted. They lie on the same bed. Persefoni listens to her mother breathe. She doesn't sleep.

13. **4am — the heart attack.** Rosemary wakes Persefoni at 4am. Throwing up all night. Wants to go to urgent care for nausea — but it's closed. They have to go to the hospital. Rosemary does NOT want to go to the hospital.

    The doctor runs tests. Looks at Persefoni: "Your mom is having a heart attack." Takotsubo / stress cardiomyopathy, possibly progressing to full MI. The mundanity makes it worse — nausea, vomiting, a reluctant hospital visit. Not a dramatic simultaneous collapse. A body quietly failing 8 hours later because the grief settled in.

    She walks out of the room. La is there, walking down the hallway. She just got there — flew from Orlando at 5am. Not just her manager walking down that hallway — her cousin. Rosemary's sister's daughter, the family showing through the professionalism. Persefoni collapses against the wall. "I can't do this. This can't be my life. They can't both die."

14. **The CICU — 7 days.** Birmingham Heart Clinic at St. Vincent's Birmingham. The labyrinth to get there: 3 sky bridges, past the cafeteria, into a secret hallway, get buzzed in, another elevator shaft. 20 minutes from the parking lot.

    **The last hallway.** Olive green walls from 1972. The handrails — big wide white oak, 2x4 slightly curved, light oak stain from an era when light oak was just what wood looked like. The stain you see on older ugly things people kept from their grandma. Running the full length of the hallway. She rests her hand on it every time. It fits her hand from her middle finger down to the heel of her palm. The last thing she does before she goes into the room. A ritual she doesn't name.

    7 days. Persefoni and La in the CICU. The slow time of a cardiac ICU. Nurse Darlene who brings coffee without being asked. La handling insurance from the hallway, George's arrangements from the cafeteria. Persefoni sitting in the chair being the daughter.

15. **After Rosemary survives.** Only after she's going to live: "Listen woman, I need you to get it together. You cannot die."

    Rosemary: "Whatever."

    This is the resentment anchor. Not "I wish it had been her" — that's cut. The devastation is quieter: a woman who has been saved and doesn't care. Rosemary's indifference to her own survival is another abandonment. "Whatever" is the cruelest word in the chapter — her mother's way of saying she would have gone with him if they'd let her. The fury isn't that Persefoni wishes her mom had died. It's that her mother would choose to leave her too.

16. **Démion arrives.** After the Cowboys game Sunday. Flies to Birmingham (not Pensacola). Same emotional beat: he knew, he played, he came late. La was first.

    She cries into his chest. First time she's really cried since the call. The person holding the room can't cry until someone else holds the room. Until this moment no one else was.

    The walking-into is complicated. Relief and sadness. The sadness of a woman who now knows where she ranks. Not anger — she doesn't have the energy. Filed knowledge that he chose the game. Setup for 2.08.

## The Core of This Chapter

Leaving — and what leaving costs.

Every departure in Persefoni's life has had a cost she didn't see until it was too late. She left Beaverton and Kathleen's door was sealed. She left St. Pete and George died. The pattern: she moves toward the next thing and the thing behind her breaks.

This isn't cause and effect. Her leaving didn't kill George. Her leaving Beaverton didn't seal Kathleen's door. But the timing — the merciless timing — creates a narrative her body will carry even if her mind refuses to tell it: the story of a woman whose departures are followed by losses. The story of the center of gravity leaving and the things in its orbit falling apart.

The chapter is structured as a slow release — the golden years, the long distance, the decision, the move, the new city — and then the bottom falls out. The reader should feel the acceleration: pages of golden, pages of spaciousness, pages of Santa Monica sun, and then the phone rings and the floor is gone.

**Emotional architecture:** She already knows. There's no "will he survive?" tension, no real-time iMessage dread. The chapter becomes the surreal horror of moving through a world that doesn't know your father just died. "This must be a mistake" is the through-line. The Uber. The airport. The plane. The stranger. All of it filtered through disbelief. The Rosemary heart attack is delayed and mundane — nausea, throwing up, urgent care closed, reluctant hospital visit. The mundanity makes it worse.

## George's Death — The Healthcare Failure

The healthcare system fails George the way systems fail people: not through villainy but through procedure.

- Heart attack Saturday evening at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama. Rosemary calls 911. Aunt Beth calls La in Orlando.
- At the hospital: waiting room. Rosemary screaming they need to help him. They waited ten minutes. Then the cath lab. He died in the cath lab.
- The specific failure: they made him wait. The waiting room, the delay, the system that put him in a chair when he needed to be in the cath lab. George is big, George is Black, George is in a rural Alabama emergency room. The intersection of these facts with the healthcare system is not stated as racism — it's shown as delay, as the specific failure that happens when a system sees a case instead of a person.
- La navigates the aftermath — the bureaucracy, the insurance, the paperwork that descends on death like a second death. La is effective and furious and not enough.

This plants a thread that runs through Act 3: the system that failed George will fail Persefoni too. The psych ward, the legal system, the retreat center — every institution she encounters will operate on procedure instead of truth. The healthcare failure is the first system failure. It's not the last.

---

## Rosemary's Heart Attack — Delayed, Mundane

Rosemary's heart attack is NOT simultaneous with George's death. It happens 8 hours later, at 4am in a Birmingham hotel room.

The sequence: nausea → throwing up all night → wants urgent care → it's closed → reluctant hospital visit → "your mom is having a heart attack."

The mundanity is the point. It's not a dramatic collapse in a waiting room. It's not a helicopter airlift. It's not sedation and restraints. It's a body quietly failing because the grief settled in. Rosemary drove to Birmingham, got a hotel, picked up her daughter — she was functional, she was a mom for one night. Then the body failed anyway.

Persefoni arrives at the hospital to find La already there — La flew from Orlando and arrived at the Birmingham hospital at 5am. La handles everything. The CICU at St. Vincent's Birmingham for 7 days.

---

## The Trio — Aftermath

Ashli and Kelli during this chapter:

- **Before the death:** The trio operates long-distance after Persefoni moves to LA. The group text. The voice memos. The FaceTime calls where Kelli and Persefoni riff and Ashli watches from her kitchen. The distance changes the dynamic — you can't save a seat for someone who's 2,500 miles away. The trio is real but it's remote, and remote is a different thing.

- **After the death:** Not dramatized in this chapter. The trio's response lives in 2.08 and beyond.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Wind** | The flight. The sealed plane with no connection — wind that doesn't arrive in time. The distance between LA and Alabama measured in engine noise and dark windows. |
| **Stone** | George's bungalow — the permanent thing, suddenly empty. Persefoni buying another property — another stone. The white oak handrails in the CICU hallway — wood as stone, warm from the hands that came before, the last solid thing before the room. |
| **Red** | George's warmth — extinguished. Alabama crimson. The red that drains from the chapter at the moment of the phone call. Before: warmth on the porch, the color of a family together. After: the red is gone. The chapter goes cold — olive green walls, fluorescent light, gray skin. |
| **Blue** | The fluorescent hospital light. The blue that makes everything cold. The absence of warmth in every institutional space she enters. |
| **Distance** | The central motif. Fifteen minutes becomes 2,500 miles. The Uber. The plane. The 20-minute walk from the parking lot to the CICU. Every space in this chapter is measured by the distance between bodies. |

## Threads Planted

- **The geography of guilt.** She moved to LA. Her father died. She was 2,500 miles away. The guilt isn't stated but the body carries it.
- **La as crisis manager and family.** La arrives at 5am in a Birmingham hospital hallway — not just a manager in crisis mode, but a cousin whose aunt is dying. La handles the insurance, the arrangements, the world. The professionalism is real, but so is the blood. Establishes La as the person who fights the system. In Act 3, La will do the same thing.
- **Rosemary's "whatever."** The word Persefoni will carry. The indifference to survival that is another form of abandonment. When Rosemary appears in Act 3, the reader knows: this is a woman who didn't want to survive.
- **The system fails.** Healthcare fails George — the waiting room, the delay. First institutional failure in the book.
- **She followed him.** Persefoni moved to LA because Démion's career moved to LA. The orbit shift is the structural setup for the emptiness in 2.09.
- **She buys her own place.** The one thread of independence she never lets go of.
- **The shoes.** The last shoes he ever bought her. Physical anchor of grief and disbelief.
- **The handrail.** The white oak rail in the CICU hallway. The last thing she touches before entering the room. A ritual of contact with something solid.

---

## Key Lines

- "TELL HER I LOVE HER. AND ROLL TIDE." — George's last words Persefoni hears, shouted from the driver's seat
- "They said he died, but that can't be true, because if he died, these are the last shoes he ever bought me." — the shoes
- "My dad died." / "When?" / "I don't know. I think just now. I think they made a mistake." — the stranger on the plane
- "I can't do this. This can't be my life. They can't both die." — the hallway collapse
- "Whatever." — Rosemary's response to surviving

---

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not critical of Démion. He moved for football. She followed for love. Neither is wrong. The chapter doesn't assign blame for the geography — it just shows the cost.
- It's not a grief chapter with real-time tension. There's no "will he survive?" The grief is immediate and total. The chapter becomes about moving through the world after.
- It's not about the healthcare system. The system failure is important but not the center. The center is the daughter who wasn't there, and then the daughter who has to hold the room.
- It's not leaving the trio. The geography changes but the friendship doesn't break.

---

## Resolved Questions

- **When does George die?** November 2026. Saturday evening. Right before Persefoni's 24th birthday. George and Rosemary were driving to LA, stopped at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama.
- **How does the healthcare failure manifest?** The waiting room. They made him wait. Ten minutes in the waiting room while Rosemary screamed. Then the cath lab. He died in the cath lab.
- **Does Persefoni make it in time?** No, and the question is different now. She already knows he's dead before she boards the plane. There's no "almost." The flight is about moving through disbelief, not racing against time.
- **Where is Rosemary's heart attack?** Birmingham. 4am, 8 hours after George's death. At a hospital ER, not in a waiting room. Mundane presentation: nausea, vomiting, reluctant hospital visit. CICU at St. Vincent's Birmingham for 7 days.
- **Where is Démion?** In Dallas for Sunday's game against the Cowboys. La called him Saturday night. He knew her father was dead before the game. He played. Flew to Birmingham after the game, arrives Sunday night at the CICU. Same emotional beat as before but geography is Birmingham, not Pensacola.
- **All communication:** Voice. Phone calls. No text messages in this chapter. Road-trip updates are Rosemary calling from the car. La's one text before the plane is the exception: "I love you."
- **"I wish it had been her":** Cut. Replaced by Rosemary's "whatever" as the resentment anchor. The resentment isn't wishing her mom had died — it's fury that her mother would choose to leave her too.

---

## Handoff to 2.08

2.08 is Démion's POV. Key continuity:
- **Geography:** Birmingham, not Pensacola. St. Vincent's Birmingham CICU.
- **La's calls to Démion:** Saturday night (George in hospital / dead), Sunday morning (confirmation). Démion plays the Cowboys game, flies to Birmingham.
- **Rosemary's condition:** In the CICU, stabilized after Takotsubo/MI. Not sedated or restrained — just flat, indifferent. The "whatever" woman.
- **Persefoni when Démion arrives:** In the olive green hallway outside her mother's room. Has been holding the room for over 24 hours. Hasn't really cried. Collapses into him.
- **Setting details Démion would notice:** The labyrinth to the CICU, the olive green walls, the handrails, the fluorescent light, the smallness of the space for his body.

**NOTE:** 2.08 currently references Pensacola/Sacred Heart and the old timeline (Rosemary airlifted, sedated, restrained). It will need updates to match the new Birmingham geography and Rosemary's delayed heart attack.

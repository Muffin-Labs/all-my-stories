# Chapter 1.11 — The Hollowness

**POV:** Persefoni (third person limited)
**Setting:** Beaverton, Oregon. Persefoni's bedroom / Alejandro's studio / screens
**Time span:** September 2020 through late May 2021. Persefoni is 17 (turns 18 in Nov 2020). Ends with her leaving Beaverton for good.
**Timeline:** Immediately follows 1.10. Kathleen is gone. Persefoni and Alejandro are together. Opens during the September 2020 smoke apocalypse (wildfires, AQI 500+, orange sky, ash falling — can't go outside, COVID lockdown + smoke lockdown). Covers the long plateau (Oct 2020, Phase 1 stalled, online school, fall sports cancelled), the November "freeze" (6 people max, restaurants shuttered again, going backwards), December Extreme Risk tier, the February 2021 ice storm (330K without power, trees crashing, the accumulated lowest point), and the return to hybrid school (April 19–22, 2021 — two days/week, masked, half-empty hallways, simulcast).

## What This Chapter Does

1. Opens on the morning after — the same morning 1.10 covers, but from inside Persefoni. She wakes up in Alejandro's bed, in his blue light, in his room that smells like cable insulation and laptop heat. The loop station still humming. "Stone-HENGE" still loaded. She knows where she is before she opens her eyes. The bed is wrong — not wrong like dangerous, wrong like a word used in the right sentence but the wrong language. She feels him watching her. She feels the weight of his tenderness arriving before she's ready for it. She's not in love. She's in the aftermath. Last night happened to her body before her mind could catch up, and now her mind is catching up, and what it's catching up to is: she didn't choose this. She was lonely and he was the only person who could see her and the seeing overwhelmed her and now she's in his bed and the blue light is on her skin and she can feel him building the story already — the love story, the origin myth, the framework — and she can't correct it because correcting it would mean being alone, and alone is the one thing she cannot survive right now.
2. "I told Kathleen." The text arrives on her phone. Three words. A period. And the floor drops out. She never got to say anything — never got to shape the telling, to be in the room when the bomb went off, to say her version. Alejandro told *his* version. "We both felt it" — his reading, not hers. "It's been building" — his narrative, imposed on months of creative partnership that felt different from her side. "I respect you too much to lie" — making him the hero of a story about integrity when the real story was a boy who wanted a girl so badly he read her overwhelm as desire and announced it as fact. She knows this. She sees through it immediately. She knows she was claimed, not met. And she stays anyway — because he is all she has left.
3. The hollowness. Kathleen won't answer. The door is shut. Persefoni texts, calls, drafts long messages and deletes them. Nothing comes back. The phone is a wall. She holds it and the holding is the loneliest thing she's ever done — lonelier than the fame, lonelier than the pressed flower — because this loneliness is earned.
4. The not-relationship. They are not a couple. They are not public. Neither of them would do that to Kathleen. They had sex once — the Stone-HENGE night — and Persefoni has no intention of it happening again. But Alejandro thinks they are in a relationship. He thinks the night meant what he told Kathleen it meant. Persefoni does not. She sees the arrangement clearly: she's using him for content strategy (he's literally making her money), and he wants her (the sex, the closeness, the love story he's building in his head). She lets him believe they're together because he's all she has left. Not love. Survival. He grows increasingly frustrated that the physical intimacy never returns. She deflects every time with classic Persefoni misdirection: excuses that point toward the truth without ever saying it outright.
5. Sheepey goes public. This is the chapter's gut punch. The character that was born in a car with Kathleen — the most private, most intimate creation — becomes content. It happens because Persefoni can't do Sheepey alone anymore. The duet lost its other voice. She puts Sheepey on camera because strangers will laugh and the laughter fills something, even if it fills the wrong shape.
6. Her 18th birthday. November 7, 2020 — just before the freeze. George grills in November. Rosemary makes a real cake, three layers, frosting uneven. Alejandro brings flowers. The gathering is small because the rules say 6 people max, 2 households — and the mandated smallness makes the real smallness visible: Kathleen is not here. The empty chair is not literally empty (Alejandro is in it) but it is Kathleen-empty. George gives a toast. Rosemary's eyes are wet. She blows out the candles. The last birthday with George alive, though nobody knows that yet.
7. Sheepey succeeds. The audience loves him. Alejandro maps the strategy. The character scales. Merch conversations begin. The seven-dollar stuffed sheep from the Stonehenge gift shop could become a product — copies, inventory, the thing that was a family member becoming a product line. The Master's purest creation swallowed by the Emissary's platform.
8. Démion Reyes slides into her DMs. Early March 2021, right after the ice storm. She already knows exactly who he is — she's been watching him on her father's couch since September, thirteen Saturdays in the elephant shirt, falling for him since October without admitting it. The Championship just confirmed what her body already knew. She never looked him up on Instagram. Now his name is on her screen. 6'6", 250 lbs, the physical opposite of Alejandro in every dimension. She reads his message and feels *want* — not for the first time (it's been building for months on that couch) but for the first time she lets herself feel it without the cover of football. Not relief. Not survival. Choice.
9. School reopens in April. Persefoni goes back for one reason: Kathleen. Not the education — she's a millionaire. The school building is the only place Kathleen can't digitally seal her out. But Kathleen's locker is empty. She transferred. Persefoni drives to Kathleen's house. Her parents are kind but firm: "Kathleen can't come to the door." They won't elaborate. She stands on the porch of the house where everything started and the door is a wall and the wall is soft and the softness is final. She sees no way to get her friend back.
10. She tries for two months. Every avenue to Kathleen is sealed. School is useless. Démion gets drafted by Tampa Bay on April 29. He talks about "the free state of Florida" — no masks, restaurants open, life at full volume. The opposite of Beaverton. She visits him in late May and never comes back. Doesn't come home. Doesn't walk at graduation. Doesn't bother to graduate. She leaves the way Kathleen left — without announcement, without a scene. The quietest departures are the most permanent.

## The Core Tragedy

The fires.

The chapter opens in September 2020 and the world is literally on fire. The wildfires that blanket the Willamette Valley during the week of September 7–14 are the most visceral thing that happens to Beaverton during the entire pandemic — AQI 500+, the sky orange-brown then deep eerie red, ash falling like snow, the sun a dim red disc or invisible, visibility dropping to 50 feet. You can't go outside. You can't open the windows. The air will burn your throat. COVID lockdown plus smoke lockdown. Post-apocalyptic.

And this is when Persefoni loses Kathleen.

The fires are her personal hell. She broke the thing she loved most and the sky turned the color of what she did — red, the Master's color, but poisoned now, the warmth become heat become suffocation. She can't breathe outside because the smoke. She can't breathe inside because the guilt. She's sealed in a house with parents who don't see her (George narrates, Rosemary watches), sealed away from the friend who won't answer, sealed into a relationship she didn't choose — and the sky is the color of a bruise and the ash settles on everything and the air itself is trying to kill her. The world is telling her, in the most literal way possible, that she cannot escape what she's done. The smoke gets in through the cracks. The guilt gets in through the cracks. There is no room in Beaverton, Oregon where she can take a clean breath.

Persefoni was already the loneliest she'd ever been before the betrayal — fame loneliness, the pressed flower, nobody seeing the real her. Then the one person who DID see the real her disappeared because of what Persefoni did. The guilt isn't abstract. It's specific. It's Kathleen's face — the bright hazel eyes, the exclamation marks, the girl who bounced on the bed — and that face is gone and it's Persefoni's fault. And while she carries this, the sky won't stop burning.

She can't apologize because Kathleen won't answer. She can't explain because there's nothing to explain that would help. She can't go outside because the air is poison. She earned this loneliness. She broke the thing she loved most and she can't even pick up the pieces because the pieces won't let her touch them and the air between her and the pieces would burn her lungs.

So she clings to Alejandro. Not because the relationship is right. Because he's THERE. He's the only person left who knows her real name — not the internet's name. He wrote "Stone-HENGE." He saw through the pressed flower. He is the one person in her life, period, because Kathleen is gone and her parents don't count and the millions of followers are wallpaper and the sky is on fire and his studio has an air purifier.

The life raft isn't love. It's the terror of being completely alone inside the fame while the world outside is literally uninhabitable.

## The Hollowness — Kathleen's Absence

### The Unanswered Messages

Persefoni tries. She texts. She calls. She drafts long messages and deletes them. She drafts short ones. "I'm sorry." "Please." "Can we talk." Nothing comes back. The phone is a wall. She holds it and the holding is the loneliest thing she's ever done — lonelier than the fame, lonelier than the pressed flower — because this loneliness is earned.

The specific cruelty: Alejandro told Kathleen first. He didn't give Persefoni the chance to do it herself, to shape the telling, to be in the room (even a digital room) when the bomb went off. By the time Persefoni knew — "I told Kathleen," the text sitting on her screen like a conclusion to a proof she was never shown — Kathleen's door was already shut. Persefoni was never in the hallway. She arrived at a wall where a door used to be.

A fight would be better. A fight has two people in the room. Screaming, tears, accusations — at least those are sounds, at least those are contact. This is one person in the room and one person gone, and the gone person left because of something real and true and unfixable, and the person left behind can't even say "I know" because saying "I know" requires someone to say it to.

### What She Can't Name

She knows, on some level she can't articulate, that what she lost in Kathleen was the realest thing she had. Kathleen saw her before anyone else did. Kathleen held the phone — literally, physically, before the tripod replaced her hands. Kathleen was the audience of one before the audience of millions. Kathleen said "do it again" and meant the girl, not the video.

Now the audience of millions is here and the audience of one is gone, and the trade feels catastrophically wrong, but she can't say why because the world is telling her she has everything. She's famous. She's beautiful. She has a boy who thinks he's her boyfriend, who sees through the brand, who is literally making her money. She has ten million followers and growing. By every metric the world uses to measure a life, she is winning.

The hollowness doesn't care about metrics.

## The Life Raft — Alejandro

### Clinging, Not Choosing

She goes to Alejandro's. Not because she wants to — because she has nowhere else to go. And because the smoke gives her a reason that isn't the real reason. "I can't be in my house." True. The air in her house is bad — the old windows don't seal right, the smoke creeps in, her room smells like campfire. His studio has an air purifier, a HEPA filter humming in the corner, his parents bought it the first day the AQI hit 300. She can breathe in his room. She can breathe in his blue light. The smoke gives her permission to go to the only place she was going to go anyway — and the permission matters because without it she'd have to say "I need you" and she can't say that because "I need you" is not the same as "I want you" and the gap between those two things is the entire foundation of a relationship she can't afford to examine.

His studio, his blue light, his careful hands. He's tender. He's devoted. He thinks this is the beginning of something. She knows it's the wreckage of something else, but she can't tell him that because telling him would mean being alone, and alone is the one thing she cannot be right now.

She lets him hold her. She lets him think this is love. She participates in being loved. Because the alternative — correcting his reading, naming the misread, saying "I was lonely and you were there" — would capsize the only boat in the water. Outside, the ash falls. Inside, the HEPA filter hums. The air in this room is the cleanest air available to her, and the relationship in this room is the only relationship available to her, and both of those things are true, and neither of them is love.

The terror: if she tells the truth, she loses Alejandro too. And then she has nobody. The fame doesn't count. The followers don't count. George and Rosemary don't count — George is narrating her story as his story, Rosemary is watching with an instinct she can't articulate. Without Alejandro, Persefoni is a girl in a room with ten million people and not a single person who knows her. And the room is full of smoke.

### What He Provides

Alejandro reads her grief about Kathleen and tries to soothe it. "She'll be okay." "Give her time." "You didn't do anything wrong." Every one of those sentences is a tiny lie that Persefoni accepts because the truth — I DID do something wrong, and the wrong thing was you, and I'm here because I have nowhere else to be — would leave her with nothing.

He's not a bad boyfriend. He's attentive, thoughtful, present in his way. He plays her new music. He talks about McGilchrist. He touches her hair gently, precisely, like something he's studied. And she feels cared for. Not unloved. Not mistreated. Just translated. Everything she does passes through his framework before it reaches him. She laughs and he classifies the laugh. She says something cutting and he admires the precision. She's being appreciated — expertly, thoroughly appreciated — and appreciation is not the same as being met.

Being met was Kathleen on the bed, cross-legged, saying "do it again" without knowing why. Being appreciated is Alejandro explaining why.

### The Transaction

It's not lost on Persefoni. She sees the deal clearly.

She's using him. He's brilliant — he turned "Stone-HENGE" from a lockdown reel into a platform. He turned Sheepey from a private joke into a brand. He maps her Instagram analytics, optimizes her engagement metrics, builds her content calendar. Every strategic decision he makes is correct, and every correct decision makes her richer. She's a millionaire because of his mind, and she knows it.

He wants her. Not cruelly — he'd never frame it that way — but he wants the relationship, the closeness, the love story he's been building in his head since "Stone-HENGE." He wants the sex to happen again. He wants what he thinks the night meant. He wants Persefoni to be his girlfriend in the way he's already told Kathleen she is.

She is not his girlfriend. She has never been his girlfriend. They had sex once and she has no intention of doing it again. But she lets him believe they're together — lets him sit in the ambiguity, lets the word "girlfriend" hang uncontested — because he's all she has. Without Alejandro, she loses the strategy, the HEPA filter, the blue light, the one person who knows her real name. She needs his brain. She needs his platform knowledge. She's a millionaire because of his mind. And the price of his mind is letting him think this is a relationship.

The deal is perfectly ugly: he provides the strategy that makes her money, she provides the presence that lets him believe he's loved. She knows the deal. He doesn't. He thinks they're in a love story with a slow start. She knows they're in a transaction where only one party read the terms.

### The Sex (Once — The Stone-HENGE Night)

It happened once. The night of "Stone-HENGE." That's it. Covered in 1.09 from Persefoni's side. Notably absent from 1.10 — Alejandro's chapter skips the sex entirely. That omission is intentional.

### It Never Happens Again

It happened once and it is never happening again. She knows this the morning after — walking home through the smoke haze, she already knows. The sex was the consequence of the song, of the being-seen, of the loneliness overwhelming her body before her mind could intervene. It was not the beginning of something. It was the end of a night. And when the sky turns red and the smoke seals them in and the world becomes hell, it's as if the apocalypse arrived to confirm what she already felt: that night was a rupture, a thing that broke the world, and the fires are the world telling her so. When the smoke finally clears on September 26th, she disowns it. All of it. The sex, the physical closeness, the pretense that this was ever a relationship of the body. As if hell landed on earth and caused the betrayal and when hell receded she disowned it. She keeps the lifeline. She drops the lie.

But Alejandro thinks they are in a relationship. He thinks the night was the beginning. He thinks the physical intimacy will resume once the smoke clears, once the stress eases, once she processes Kathleen. He's patient. He's Alejandro — he can wait. He builds the framework for waiting: she's grieving, she needs time, the relationship will deepen when she's ready. The framework is elegant and completely wrong.

What follows is months of his wanting and her redirecting. She never says no. She never gives an excuse. She just isn't there when the moment arrives. He reaches for her and she's already showing him something on her phone — "look at this comment, this is insane." He reaches for her and she's suddenly mid-idea, talking fast, pulling him into a content strategy question that his brain can't resist answering. He reaches for her and she asks him to play that thing he was working on, the one with the cello sample, and his hands go to the mixing board instead. He reaches for her and she says something so funny he forgets what he was reaching for. She never closes the door. She just opens a different one — every time, effortlessly, so smoothly he doesn't even realize he's been redirected until the moment has passed. Classic Persefoni: she doesn't manage the situation with excuses. She manages it with attention — moving his, directing it somewhere else, giving him something better to think about than the thing she's withholding. The Personality's gift weaponized as kindness.

Alejandro never brings it up. He can't. He's too infatuated, too intimidated, too aware that she is Persefoni and he is the kid with the loop station who can't believe she's in his room. He wants her — desperately, obviously, in the way his body angles toward her when they're on the couch, in the way his hand lands on her knee and lingers, in the way he sits too close when they're looking at her phone together. But he never says it. He never asks. He just tries — small, unspoken, physical angles at intimacy. A hand on her lower back. Leaning in. Brushing her hair behind her ear. Each one a question he's too afraid to ask out loud, and each one she redirects so smoothly that he pulls back with the look of a kid who just got gently reprimanded without anyone raising their voice. The tightening around his mouth. The hands going to the mixing board instead. The frameworks getting louder as his body gets quieter. The frustration accumulates in the room like the smoke accumulated in the valley: invisible at first, then hazy, then hard to breathe through. But neither of them names it. He won't because he's afraid the answer is no. She won't because the answer IS no and saying it would end the arrangement.

She handles each one the same way she handles everything — by redirecting. She's Persefoni. She can navigate any conversation, defuse any bomb, move any attention. She doesn't argue. She doesn't explain. She gives him something else to focus on — his music, her content, the work they're building — and the something else is always genuinely interesting, and his mind takes the bait every time because his mind is hungry and she knows exactly what to feed it. The thing she never says: they are not in a relationship. They never were. They had sex once and she is never doing it again and the only reason she's in this room is because his brain makes her money and his HEPA filter makes the air breathable and his presence keeps her from being completely alone.

He thinks they're in a love story with a slow physical start. She knows there is no love story. There is a girl in a room with a boy who makes her money and wants her body, and she is giving him the first and withholding the second, and the withholding is the most honest thing about her. The body she's withholding from Alejandro is the same body that will respond, involuntarily, every Saturday on her father's couch, to a man on a screen who doesn't know she exists.

### The Performance

She is convincing because she is Persefoni and Persefoni is convincing at everything — that's the gift, that's the curse, the parasocial eye contact works in person too. She doesn't have to say "I'm your girlfriend." She just doesn't say "I'm not." She lets the ambiguity do the work. She's present in his studio. She listens to his music. She laughs at the right moments. She lets him touch her hair. She doesn't correct the framework he's building — the one where this is a love story with a slow start, where the physical part will come when she's ready, where patience is proof of depth. Alejandro thinks he's in a love story. She knows she's in a transaction. And the gap between those two readings is the exact same gap as "Stone-HENGE" — he read desire where she felt relief — except now the gap is a not-relationship, and they live inside it, and only one of them can see it for what it is.

## Sheepey Goes Public

### Stage 1 — The Silence

Sheepey goes quiet. Weeks without the voice. Not a decision — an inability. The character was always a duet — Persefoni narrating what Sheepey thinks, Kathleen as the straight man pushing back. "He doesn't approve." "Of what?" "Of any of this, Kathleen." The architecture of the bit requires two people talking ABOUT him and there is one person and an empty chair.

She catches herself almost doing it — something happens and she thinks of a Sheepey story she would have told Kathleen, something about the time he got lost in Salisbury or his strong feelings about Victorian horse breeds — and she stops. Because the bit needs someone to receive it. Telling Sheepey stories to nobody is a monologue, and Sheepey was never a monologue. Sheepey was a conversation between two girls about a stuffed sheep's ridiculous life, and the other girl is gone.

Alejandro notices the absence. He gets Sheepey — loves Sheepey, actually, thinks the character is brilliant — he just can't do the bit himself because improvisation isn't his gift. He can map the comedy structurally, explain why it works, but he can't riff. That was always Kathleen and Persefoni's territory. So he notices when the stories stop and he doesn't know why and he doesn't ask because asking would mean naming Kathleen and naming Kathleen is the one thing neither of them does.

### Stage 2 — The Break

She's filming. An Instagram reel. Something about lockdown, something throwaway. And Sheepey comes out. Not planned. A story just arrives — the way they always arrived, unbidden, the character's history asserting itself. She starts telling the camera about something Sheepey did, some adventure from his past, the absurd specificity of his life before she found him at Stonehenge — the places he's been, the things he's seen, the dignity he maintains despite everything.

And she's mid-reel, mid-story, and Sheepey is THERE — his world alive, posh, absurd, funny — and for a moment the hollowness fills with something that feels almost like the real thing. She doesn't stop. She keeps going. The camera catches it.

She watches the playback. Sheepey is good. Sheepey is her.

But it's not the same. The difference between Sheepey-with-Kathleen and Sheepey-for-the-camera is invisible to anyone who never heard the original. It's like a cover of a song by the original artist — technically perfect, emotionally one degree off. Only someone who was in the room when the song was written would hear the difference. And the only person who was in the room doesn't answer the phone anymore.

She posts it because posting is the only way to complete the circuit now — the audience on the other end, the laughter she needs, the response that used to come from Kathleen's side of the bed.

### Stage 3 — The Audience Loves Him

It explodes. Of course it does. Sheepey is the most Persefoni thing she's ever put on camera — funnier than her dances, more intimate than her storytelling reels, more real than anything the brand has produced. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge bypasses every defense the audience has. Comments flood. People want more Sheepey. The character has an audience of millions now.

Alejandro sees the numbers and says something perfectly Alejandro — something about the character being her most authentic brand expression, about how Sheepey bypasses the parasocial barrier because the voice is so specific it can't be faked. He maps the strategy. He's analytically, structurally, completely right. And being right is the problem, because Sheepey didn't need a strategy. Sheepey needed Kathleen on the bed saying "do it again" and instead Sheepey got an analytics dashboard.

### Stage 4 — Sheepey Scales

Sheepey becomes a recurring feature. The character grows. The comments are full of love — strangers who feel like they know this sheep, who quote his lines, who make fan art, who say "Sheepey is the best thing on the internet." And every one of those comments is a hand reaching through a screen, and none of them are Kathleen's hand, and the difference between a million hands and the one hand that matters is the distance between being watched and being known.

The merch conversation. Someone — a brand deal, or Alejandro mentions it with the casual precision of a boy who's already modeled the revenue — suggests a Sheepey plush. A stuffed sheep. Mass-produced. The seven-dollar original from the Stonehenge gift shop, reproduced at scale. Copies. Inventory. The thing that was a family member becoming a product line.

"One sees copies. The other sees families." The Emissary's platform turning the Master's creation back into what it was before Persefoni picked it up: a copy. A thing on a shelf. A product with a price tag and a SKU, stitched by a machine in a factory, identical to a thousand others. Everything Persefoni gave that sheep — the name, the voice, the dignity, the drinking problem, the backstory, the soul — reduced to a product spec.

Persefoni feels something when she hears this — a flinch, a recoil, something deep and inarticulate. She can't explain why the idea makes her sick because explaining it would require saying "Sheepey was Kathleen's too" and she can't say Kathleen's name without the hollowness swallowing her whole.

## The Not-Relationship — Montage Beats

### What It Looks Like From the Outside

They spend every day together at his studio — her content, their collaboration. She goes to him. He doesn't come to her house except for the birthday. George and Rosemary know Alejandro exists — their daughter goes to his studio every day — but they don't see the dynamic up close. George probably assumes something, narrates it to himself as young love, but Persefoni doesn't confirm and doesn't deny and George doesn't push because George narrates and narrating doesn't require confirmation. Rosemary watches. She always watches.

### What It Looks Like From Inside

Late nights in his studio. The blue light. The loop station humming. He plays her tracks-in-progress. She listens the way she's always listened — receiving the music with her whole body, hearing things he didn't know he put there. He watches her listen and the watching is love, his kind of love, the Emissary's love: attentive, precise, cataloging her responses, learning her the way he learns everything. She is the most interesting data set he has ever encountered and he will spend years studying her and never once wonder if she wants to be studied.

He helps her with her brand. He helps her with everything. The Instagram strategy evolves — more Sheepey, more voice, more of the mind behind the dancer. He's building her architecture the way he built "Stone-HENGE": layer by layer, precise, the Emissary's gift to the Master. And the architecture is good. And the building is care. And the care is real. And the care is not enough. And she lets him do it because his care makes her rich and his frameworks make her famous and the alternative — doing this alone — is unthinkable. She sees the deal. He doesn't. He thinks the strategy is love in a different language. She knows the strategy is the language, and there is no love behind it.

### George and Rosemary in the Margins

George is narrating. His daughter is famous. His daughter is the most interesting thing that's ever happened to him and he's making it his story. "My baby girl" on every phone call. The pride that sounds like love and functions as ownership.

Rosemary watches from a quieter distance. She sees something George doesn't — something in her daughter's eyes, something that looks like the gap between smiling and being happy. But Rosemary doesn't have the language. She's never had the language. She just has the instinct, and the instinct says something is off, and she files it the way she's always filed her instincts — beneath George's louder, warmer, more confident narrative. The same dynamic. The Emissary overwriting the Master's perception. George narrates Rosemary the way Alejandro narrates Persefoni: with love, with confidence, with total certainty that misses everything.

---

## The Ending

Persefoni in her bedroom. Fairy lights on, but they're positioned for the camera now, not for warmth. She's just filmed a Sheepey reel — a good one, maybe the best one yet. The stories fully alive, the comedy landing, the absurd history of a stuffed sheep masking the heartbreak underneath the way it always does.

She watches the playback. It's perfect.

She picks up her phone. Opens Kathleen's contact. The name still there — the name that used to light up the screen twelve times a day, the name with the exclamation marks, the name that was the most consistent thing in her life. Her thumb hovers. She types: "I did Sheepey on Instagram today. I think you would have—"

She stops. Deletes it. The sentence she can't finish. I think you would have laughed. I think you would have said "do it again." I think you would have known this isn't the same and loved me anyway.

She posts the reel.

The exclamation marks come in waves. None of them are Kathleen's.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Fire / Smoke** | **The chapter's dominant environmental motif.** Persefoni's personal hell. The September 2020 wildfires are not backdrop — they are the externalization of everything she's carrying. The sky turns red (the Master's color, but poisoned — warmth become heat become suffocation). The air burns. Ash falls like snow. She can't breathe outside (smoke) or inside (guilt). She's sealed in — COVID lockdown plus smoke lockdown, no escape. The smoke gets in through the cracks the way the guilt gets in through the cracks. She goes to Alejandro's because his studio has an air purifier — the smoke gives her permission to cling without naming the clinging. The fires started somewhere else and arrived here, the way the betrayal started with Alejandro's telling and arrived at Persefoni already done. The smoke eventually clears (late September) but the hollowness doesn't. The world becomes breathable again and she is still suffocating. That's when she knows the smoke was never the problem. |
| **Stone** | The not-relationship as architecture — solid, well-built, cold. Alejandro constructed this in his head. The "relationship" is his most ambitious structure, and he's the only one who thinks it exists. Also: Sheepey's origin at Stone-henge. The stones were built to be listened to. Now millions are listening to a copy. |
| **Wind** | What's missing. The relationship has no spontaneity, no surprise, no breath. Everything is structured, optimized, strategic. Kathleen was wind — she arrived, she warmed, she left without announcing it. The wind is gone from Persefoni's life. She lives in rooms with no draft. Also: the wind is literally absent during the smoke — still air, no breeze, the smoke hanging motionless in the valley because there's nothing to move it. The Willamette Valley is a basin. The smoke pools. The wind that would clear it doesn't come. |
| **Blue** | Dominant. She's in Alejandro's world now. His studio, his strategy, his color. The blue of screens — Instagram, the content machine, the fame apparatus. She spends more time in his blue-lit studio than her own bedroom. His wavelength, everywhere. The HEPA filter humming in the blue room — the Emissary's technology making the air breathable, making itself necessary. |
| **Red** | Corrupted. The sky is red but it's the wrong red — not warmth, not firelight, not the red-gold of her curls in lantern light. It's the red of destruction, of 1.5 million acres burning, of a sun that looks like a wound. The Master's color turned apocalyptic. Her fairy lights are still there but repositioned for the camera — functional, not warm. Her bedroom is becoming a set. The red-gold that was hers is dimming, subordinated to blue indoors and poisoned to smoke-red outdoors. Nowhere in this chapter is red safe. |
| **Copies / Families** | The central motif. Sheepey was a family member — born in love, named in play, alive because someone saw him. Public Sheepey is a copy — reproduced, branded, consumed. The merch conversation is the most literal version: a copy of a copy, inventory again, the thing that was alive because a girl picked it up becoming a product stitched by machines. "One sees copies. The other sees families." The Emissary's platform turning families back into copies. |
| **Exclamation Marks** | The absence and the wrong replacement. Kathleen's exclamation marks are gone — the specific, personal, warm exclamation marks that arrived twelve times a day. The comments section is full of exclamation marks from strangers — "OMG SHEEPEY!!!" "I LOVE HIM!!!" — and they are not the same. A million exclamation marks from strangers do not equal one from Kathleen. |
| **The Life Raft** | New motif for this chapter. The relationship as survival, not choice. Clinging, not holding. The difference between gripping a life raft and being held by someone who loves you — one is desperation, the other is rest. Persefoni doesn't rest in this relationship. She grips. |

## Threads Planted

- **The fires as Persefoni's hell.** The September smoke apocalypse is not setting — it's the externalization of everything she's carrying. The sky turns her color (red) but poisons it. She can't breathe. She's sealed in. The smoke gives her the excuse to go to Alejandro's ("I can't breathe at my house") without naming the real reason. When the smoke clears and the suffocation doesn't, that's the turn — the realization that the world was just being honest about how she felt and has now stopped. The fires plant the sensory vocabulary that will return in the desert (Act 3) and in the retreat — heat, breath, air, the body's relationship to atmosphere.
- **The hollowness as engine.** Everything Persefoni does in this chapter — clinging to Alejandro, putting Sheepey on camera, maintaining the not-relationship — is driven by the hollowness Kathleen left behind. The betrayal's consequence isn't punishment. It's emptiness.
- **Sheepey as brand asset.** The character going public sets up the larger arc: the Cult of Personality consuming everything authentic. Persefoni's most real creation becomes her most profitable content. This is the mechanism that will eventually consume her entirely — the thing the retreat strips away.
- **The merch conversation.** Copies. The seven-dollar sheep becoming inventory again. This plants the seed that the Cult of Personality doesn't destroy authentic things — it reproduces them until the reproduction replaces the original. Worse than theft. Copies.
- **"Being appreciated is not the same as being met."** She's not leaving Alejandro because he's bad. She's leaving because she was never with him — he just thinks she was. She's hollow and he can't fill the hollow because filling it would require him to see it, and seeing it would require him to see that there is no relationship, and seeing THAT would require him to see that "Stone-HENGE" was a misread and the single night was an ending, not a beginning. The Emissary can't see the misread because the misread is the foundation of his entire model.
- **The last birthday with George.** November 7, 2020. She turns 18. George grills in November, Rosemary makes a three-layer cake, Alejandro brings flowers. The mandated smallness (6 people, 2 households) makes the real smallness visible — Kathleen is not here. This is the last birthday with George alive, though nobody knows it. Plants George's death in Act 2 — the reader will remember the charcoal, the Intel jacket, the toast, the man who narrated everything including his daughter's eighteenth birthday, and will feel his absence when it arrives. Also plants Rosemary's cake — the effort, the uneven frosting, the mother trying with her hands because she doesn't have the words. Rosemary's hands will matter in Act 3.
- **Rosemary's instinct.** She sees something off. She can't name it. This plants her role in Act 3 — the mother watching from outside the narrative, loving without understanding, the instinct that will eventually be all Persefoni has left.
- **Kathleen's house.** The final attempt. Persefoni goes from digital rejection (unanswered texts) to physical rejection (the empty locker) to the most devastating rejection of all: kind parents on a porch who won't let her in. The escalation from screen to hallway to doorstep — each more real, each more final. She exhausts every avenue. Two months of trying. The door stays shut and the shutting is gentle and the gentleness is permanent. This is what makes the departure to Florida possible — not Démion's pull but Kathleen's sealed door.
- **Performing grief as content.** Persefoni turns pain into performance. This is her pattern — the same thing she'll do with the shaved head, the same instinct the retreat will finally interrupt. The girl who can make anything into a character, including her own devastation. The Personality's survival mechanism: if you perform the pain, you don't have to feel it. Except you do. Except it's still there underneath the performance, and the performance just puts an audience between you and the feeling.
- **The gap as the not-relationship.** Alejandro thinks he's in a love story. She knows she's in a transaction. The gap between those readings IS the dynamic. Same gap as the song. Same gap as the yurt. Same gap as everything — two people in the same moment experiencing completely different things. But this time the gap is wider because she's not even pretending to herself: she had sex with him once, it is never happening again, and the only reason she's in his studio is because his brain makes her money and his presence keeps her from being alone. She can see the deal. He can't. One of them read the terms. The gap will keep widening until Démion walks into it.
- **The transaction as mirror.** Persefoni sees the deal clearly: she uses Alejandro for his content strategy (he's making her rich), he wants her (the body, the closeness, the love story). She gives him her presence and withholds her body and lets him believe the withholding is temporary. This plants the awareness she'll need later: the ability to see how relationships function as systems, not just feelings. She sees through the mechanism even while she's inside it. The Scientist is already waking up inside the Personality — she just can't act on what she sees yet because acting would mean being alone.
- **The redirections as the Personality's gift.** Every time Alejandro reaches for her, she doesn't say no — she gives him something else to think about. A content question his brain can't resist. A song she wants to hear. Something funny. She manages him with attention, not excuses — moving his focus, opening a different door so smoothly he doesn't realize the one he wanted was never available. This is the Personality's skill at its most elegant and its most damning: she can make anyone feel like they're getting exactly what they want while withholding the one thing that matters. She'll learn to stop doing this in Act 4. Right now, it's all she knows.
- **Démion as the Personality's answer / The slow fall.** She doesn't fall for Démion in a moment — she falls over thirteen Saturdays. The 'Bama games thread through the entire collapse: September 26 opener (first game after the smoke), through October (she starts noticing him), through the Iron Bowl (she's definitely watching), through the SEC Championship (the go-ahead touchdown, something turning in her chest), through the Rose Bowl (George calling Alabama, "Roll Tide" into the phone), to the Championship on January 11th (transfixed, flushed, the most beautiful thing she's ever seen). Father and daughter on the same couch, falling for the same man for completely different reasons — George for the dominance, Persefoni for the body. The games are the one honest space in her week, the elephant shirt the one un-performed garment, and it's in THAT space — the most authentic version of herself — that the desire grows. The DM in March is not a rescue. It's the Cult of Personality offering a shinier version of the same mechanism. But the desire is real. It just isn't enough. Démion is everything the surface wants: massive, beautiful, dominant, famous, the physical opposite of Alejandro in every way. She thinks what she feels is desire — and it is — but desire is not the same as being met. He's the narrative upgrade: from the not-relationship to the real thing. The life raft to the yacht. Same ocean, same drowning, better boat. This plants the entire arc of Act 2 — where the Personality at full power, mirrored by Démion at full power, produces the emptiness that nothing can fill. She won't learn the difference between wanting someone and being met by someone until Eric.
- **She leaves the way Kathleen left.** The symmetry is invisible to her. Kathleen stopped answering. Persefoni stops coming back. Two girls who loved each other, each disappearing through a door that closes without slamming. The quietest departures are the most permanent. This echoes forward to every departure in the book — Persefoni leaving Démion after the wedding night, walking into the desert, walking naked into the street. She is always leaving. She learned how from the girl she lost.
- **She doesn't graduate.** She doesn't bother. The not-graduating is the tell — nothing in Beaverton matters except the one person who won't see her. This also plants her lack of credentials as a detail that the world will use against her later (the psych ward, the public narrative of "crazy influencer who didn't even finish high school").

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene A — The Morning After (Persefoni's Side)
The opening. Same morning as 1.10, from inside Persefoni. She wakes in Alejandro's bed. Blue light, monitors, the loop station humming "Stone-HENGE" at a volume so low it's almost not there — the sheep choir reduced to a murmur. She knows where she is before she opens her eyes. The bed is wrong. Not wrong like dangerous — wrong like a word used in the right sentence but the wrong language. She can feel him watching her, can feel his tenderness arriving before she's ready for it. Last night: the song, the being-seen, the overwhelming relief of someone reaching through the pressed flower — and then her body responded before her mind could intervene, and now she's here, and the blue light is on her skin, and the morning is happening, and she didn't choose this. She was lonely and he saw her and the seeing collapsed the distance and now she's in his bed. She gets up. She finds her shoes. "I should go." "My parents." The walk home — through the side door, into the September morning, the air already strange (the smoke is coming, the fires have started upstate, the haze is building). She walks home carrying something she can't name yet. Not regret exactly. Something more like the feeling of having been translated into someone else's language without being asked.

Then: "I told Kathleen." The text on her phone. Three words, a period. And the floor drops out. She was never in the hallway when the door shut. He told *his* version — "we both felt it," "it's been building" — and that version became the only version Kathleen heard. Persefoni's side of the story — the loneliness, the being-seen, the overwhelm that was not desire — died unspoken. She knows what Kathleen heard: the Emissary's proof. She knows what Kathleen didn't hear: the truth. She sees through his framing immediately — "I respect you too much to lie" made him the hero of a story about integrity when the real story was a boy who wanted a girl so badly he read her overwhelm as desire and announced it as fact. And she can't correct it. Correcting it would mean saying what actually happened, and saying what actually happened would mean being alone.

### Scene B — The Hollowness / Never in the Hallway
Persefoni tries to reach Kathleen. She texts. She calls. She drafts long messages and deletes them. She drafts short ones. "I'm sorry." "Please." "Can we talk." Nothing comes back. The phone is a wall. She holds it and the holding is the loneliest thing she's ever done. A fight would be better — a fight has two people in the room. This is one person in the room and one person gone. The smoke thickens outside. The sky goes orange-brown, then deep eerie red. AQI 500+. Can't open windows. Can't go outside. COVID lockdown plus smoke lockdown. Persefoni is sealed inside the house with the sky the color of a bruise and ash on the car windshield — and she's just lost her best friend, and the air outside would burn your throat, and the air inside is the hollowness. The world ending outside while her world ends inside.

### Scene C — The Life Raft
Going to Alejandro's. The smoke gives her the excuse — "I can't breathe at my house" — and the excuse is true and also not the truth. His studio, his blue light, the HEPA filter humming in the corner, the air purifier making the room habitable the way his frameworks make the relationship habitable. She can breathe here. Outside the window, the sky is the color of a bruise. Ash on the sill. The world reduced to sealed rooms. Letting him love her. Participating in being loved. The terror underneath: if she tells the truth, she loses him too, and then she has nobody — nobody and no breathable air. The gap between his reading (love story) and hers (survival). He says "she'll be okay" about Kathleen — the analgesic, the framework applied to someone else's pain — and Persefoni receives it and her face does nothing he can read because the truth would capsize the boat. She sees through his bigger narratives without him saying them — "it was going to happen eventually," "we couldn't keep pretending" — she can feel them in his certainty, and the certainty is wrong, and she can't say so. Snapshots of the not-relationship — his tenderness, his frameworks, his unspoken wanting that she redirects every time. All of it happening in a room where the air is filtered and the light is blue and the sky outside is ending.

### Scene D — Sheepey's Silence
The weeks without the voice. The smoke week bleeds into the weeks after — the sky clears eventually, late September, the AQI drops, the windows open again, and the fresh air arrives and she is still suffocating. That's when she knows. The smoke was never the problem. The smoke was just the world being honest about how she felt. Now the world has stopped being honest and she's still choking on something nobody else can see. The almost-bits that die in her mouth. The architecture of comedy that requires two people. The empty chair where the straight man sat. This is FROM HER — she knows why Sheepey went quiet. She knows it's not growth (the way Alejandro reads it). She knows it's the missing half of a duet. The specific detail: a Sheepey story rises in her — something about one of his past adventures, something absurd and specific, the time he got caught in a rainstorm in Bath or his complicated history with a particular breed of terrier — and she stops. Because the story needs Kathleen to hear it. The story has no audience.

### Scene E — The Long Collapse (Oct 2020–Mar 2021) — ABSORBED FROM 1.10
The smoke clears but nothing else does. The world outside mirrors the hollowness inside — except for one thing. One thing stays alive.

**THE 'BAMA THREAD:** George is a HUGE Alabama fan. Has been his whole life — it's in the blood, it's identity, it's religion. From Alabama, raised on it, the Crimson Tide not a team but a family sacrament. And Persefoni inherited it. "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide" — the call-and-response between father and daughter that predates everything, before fame, before Alejandro, before Kathleen, before Beaverton. She loves watching 'Bama games with her dad. It's their thing. Every game since she was eleven, she's worn the same shirt — a cartoon elephant 'Bama tee, faded and soft and too small now, the kind of shirt you'd never post on Instagram because it belongs to the version of you that existed before the camera. She puts it on without thinking. It's muscle memory. It's home.

The 2020 season starts late because of COVID — SEC plays conference-only, first game September 26th. And what happens over the next four months is magic. Alabama doesn't lose. Not once. Not even close most weeks. And each Saturday, in the middle of the smoke and the lockdown and the hollowness and the life raft and the guilt, Persefoni puts on the elephant shirt and sits on the couch with George and for a few hours she's just a daughter watching a game with her father. Not a brand. Not a personality. Not the girl in Alejandro's studio pretending to be his girlfriend. Just George's girl. The only un-performed hours of her week.

**September 26 — at Missouri, W 38-19.** The opener. The smoke has just cleared — the AQI dropped below 100 for the first time in three weeks. The windows are open. George has wings and his Crimson Tide blanket and he's on the couch and Persefoni comes downstairs in the elephant shirt and he says "Roll Tide" and she says "Roll Damn Tide" and for the first time in weeks she feels something that isn't the hollowness. 'Bama wins easy. The season has begun. She doesn't notice the freshman quarterback yet. He's just a number on a jersey.

**October — The games keep coming.** Texas A&M 52-24. Ole Miss 63-48 (a wild shootout that has George screaming). Georgia 41-24 (the statement game). Tennessee 48-17. Mississippi State 41-0 — a shutout on Halloween. Each Saturday the same ritual: elephant shirt, couch, George, wings, "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide." The games are the heartbeat of the collapse. Everything else is contracting — the lockdown, the hollowness, the life raft, the guilt — but the games expand. George is the happiest version of himself on those Saturdays, and his happiness is uncomplicated in a way nothing else in Persefoni's life is uncomplicated, and she soaks in it. She starts noticing the freshman QB somewhere around October — not consciously, not yet. Just that the camera keeps finding him. Just that he moves differently than anyone she's ever seen. Just that he's very, very large.

**November 7 — Her Birthday (Bye Week).** She turns 18. No game this Saturday — the universe giving them the night off. George makes it an event. He grills even though it's November, standing on the back patio in his Intel jacket with the charcoal going, narrating the occasion the way he narrates everything: "My baby girl is eighteen. Legal. A grown woman." He says it like he's hosting a show. Rosemary made a cake — not from a box, a real one, the kind she used to make before everything got busy, three layers, the frosting not quite even, the effort visible in the unevenness. Alejandro is there because of course Alejandro is there — he's the boyfriend, he brought flowers, he's being perfect, he's being Alejandro. The gathering is small because it has to be (6 people max, 2 households, the rules George follows to the letter because George follows rules). So it's just the four of them and maybe one more — and the smallness would be cozy if it were chosen, but it's not chosen, it's mandated, and the mandated smallness puts the real smallness in sharp relief: Kathleen is not here. Kathleen would have been here. Kathleen would have brought something ridiculous — a card with too many exclamation marks, a gift from the dollar store wrapped in newspaper, something that cost nothing and meant everything. The empty chair at the table is not literally empty — Alejandro is sitting in it — but it is Kathleen-empty, and Persefoni can feel the shape of the absence the way you feel a missing tooth with your tongue. George gives a toast. Rosemary's eyes are wet. Persefoni blows out the candles and the wish she makes is not something she'll say out loud. She is eighteen and a millionaire and famous and her mother made her a cake and her father grilled in November and her boyfriend brought flowers and the absence at the table is louder than all of it. This is the last birthday with George alive, though nobody knows that yet.

**After the freeze / Late November.** Brown orders the freeze on the 18th — the most restrictive measures since March. Restaurants back to takeout only. Social gatherings limited to 6 people from no more than 2 households. Thanksgiving with 6 people max. Going backwards. The feeling of losing ground you never gained. But on November 21st, Kentucky 63-3. And on November 28th — the Iron Bowl. Auburn. The only game that matters more than the others. Alabama 42, Auburn 13. George is incandescent. "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide" echoing through the house. They're going to the SEC Championship. The season is perfect. In the middle of the freeze, in the middle of everything contracting, 'Bama is undefeated and George is the happiest man alive and Persefoni is in the elephant shirt and the world makes sense for three hours at a time.

And she's definitely noticing the quarterback now. Not just noticing — watching. The way he drops back and surveys the field like he already knows. The way he runs and the defenders bounce off him. The way 250 lbs moves like 180. She catches herself watching and looks away and looks back. She doesn't mention this to anyone.

**December.** Extreme Risk tier. BSD announces remote through February. First vaccines arrive but teenagers are nowhere near the line. LSU 55-17. Arkansas 52-3. Then the SEC Championship — December 19th — Alabama 52, Florida 46. The greatest game of the season, a shootout, George on his feet for the entire fourth quarter, Persefoni next to him screaming, the two of them alone in the house (Rosemary doesn't do football) and the game is CLOSE and it's the most alive she's felt since September and the quarterback — Démion Reyes, she knows his name now, she's known it for weeks — throws the go-ahead touchdown and flashes that smile and something turns over in her chest that has nothing to do with the score.

**January 1 — Rose Bowl Semifinal.** Notre Dame. Alabama 31, Notre Dame 14. Not close. They're going to the Championship. George is transcendent. He calls his brother in Alabama. He calls his friends. "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide" — the phrase leaving the living room and entering the phone lines, the network of Black men from Alabama who've been waiting for this since August, and Persefoni listens to her father being purely, simply happy and she loves him so much it hurts and she's wearing the elephant shirt and Démion Reyes threw four touchdowns and she watched every single one of them with something in her body that is not football.

**January 11 — The Championship.** Alabama vs Ohio State in Miami. George has been talking about this game for weeks. Tonight he's on the couch with his Crimson Tide blanket and a plate of wings and he's practically vibrating. Persefoni is next to him in the elephant shirt, feet tucked under her. Alejandro is not here. Alejandro doesn't do football. Alejandro doesn't understand this — the couch, the blanket, the elephant shirt, the "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide," the father and daughter being simply, uncomplicatedly together inside something that predates everything. This is the one room Alejandro can't enter. Not because he's excluded — because he doesn't have the vocabulary. He'd need to build a framework for it and by the time the framework was built the game would be over.

And from the first snap she can't stop looking at Démion. Not the way George is looking — George is looking at dominance, at a system executing, at a player who seems to know what the defense will do before they do it, who improvises at a level nobody has ever seen, who runs like a man that size has no right to run. George is in LOVE — the way men fall in love with the man who brings dominant success to their team, the way that love is uncomplicated and pure and total, the way George keeps saying "look at this kid, look at this KID" and slapping the armrest.

Persefoni is looking at something else. She's looking at his arms. She's looking at his ass when he drops back. She's looking at that smile — the one he flashes after a touchdown, the one the camera finds because the camera always finds it, the grin that says *I knew this would happen*. She is transfixed. He is the most beautiful thing she's ever seen. 6'6", 250 lbs, moving like something that big shouldn't be able to move, and every time the camera catches his face she feels something in her body that she hasn't felt in months — maybe hasn't felt ever, not like this, not this involuntary, not this physical. Father and daughter on the same couch, transfixed by the same man for completely different reasons.

Alabama wins 52–24. It's not even close. Thirteen and oh. Perfect season. George is euphoric — tears in his eyes, calling Alabama, "Roll Tide" into the phone over and over. Persefoni is flushed in a way she hopes he doesn't notice. She hugs him. She means it. This was the best thing in the worst year of her life — these Saturdays, this couch, this shirt, this man who is her father being happy in a way that asks nothing of her.

She goes to her room and she doesn't look Démion up on Instagram. Not yet. But she knows his name now. She knows his number. She knows what his arms look like when he throws and what his smile looks like when he scores and she's going to carry that in her body for two months before his DM arrives and she'll open it already knowing exactly who he is. She's been falling for him since October without admitting it. The Championship just made it impossible to deny.

**February**: The ice storm. An inch of ice on power lines and trees. 330K without power. Trees crashing under ice, transformer explosions, the eerie sound of branches snapping all night. Some without power for over a week. COVID lockdown + no electricity + no heat in February. The accumulated lowest point. Through all of this, Persefoni is sealed in the life raft with Alejandro. The lockdown within the lockdown. The world contracting while she contracts inside it. This is where the hollowness calcifies — months of it, the numbness becoming structure, the guilt becoming furniture she walks around.

### Scene F — The DM (Early March 2021)
The ice storm has just ended. Power is back. The lowest point has passed — or so the world thinks. Persefoni is on Instagram, scrolling, the blue light of the phone replacing the blue light of Alejandro's studio, one screen indistinguishable from another. A DM notification. She sees the name and her body knows before her mind does. Démion Reyes. The arms. The smile. The freshman QB she's been watching on her father's couch since September — first without noticing, then noticing, then watching, then unable to stop watching. Thirteen games. Thirteen Saturdays in the elephant shirt. She's been falling for him since October and the Championship in January just made it impossible to deny and she STILL didn't look him up on Instagram — the restraint a tell in itself, the not-looking a form of looking, the way you avoid someone's eyes because meeting them would confirm something you're not ready to confirm. She's been carrying his name in her body for months. And now his name is on her screen and he's reaching through it to HER.

The message is confident, funny, not try-hard. The ease of someone who has never had to try hard at anything. Something about her Sheepey reel — he thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen, and also he thinks she's beautiful, and the way he says both things in the same sentence makes it clear he means both equally. Not a fan. Not a follower performing enthusiasm. A man who saw something he wanted and reached for it. The directness is the opposite of Alejandro — no frameworks, no analysis, no careful architecture of approach. Just: I saw you. I want to talk to you. Here I am.

She reads it and something happens in her body that hasn't happened in months. Want. Not relief, not survival, not the numb participation of the life raft. Want. Physical, immediate, involuntary — the way her body responded to Alejandro's song but this time without the confusion, without the being-seen-ness that clouded everything. This is simpler. This is the wanting she thought she felt and didn't. She recognizes it now because its absence has been the defining feature of the relationship she's in.

She responds. The responding is the first thing she's done in months that isn't survival. It's choice. They start talking — DMs at first, then texts, then late-night calls when Alejandro isn't there. She's careful, or thinks she is. But the care is the Personality managing the logistics, not the Scientist examining the ethics. She was never in a relationship with Alejandro. She has been performing proximity for months — his studio, his strategy, his presence — but she was never his girlfriend. The hollowness ate the last of whatever she was pretending was there. Démion didn't create the exit. He's the light visible through a door that was already open.

**What she doesn't see yet:** Démion is the Personality's answer to the hollowness — not the Scientist's. He is everything the surface wants. He is the narrative upgrade: from the boy who makes her money to the man who makes her feel alive. The Cult of Personality offering a bigger, shinier life raft. She thinks this is desire. It is. But desire is not the same as being met — and she doesn't know that yet because the only version of "being met" she's experienced was Alejandro's misread, which felt like suffocation. She has no baseline for what real meeting feels like. She won't until Eric.

### Scene G — The Return to School / The Only Reason (April 2021)
Over a year after schools closed. BSD high school students begin hybrid the week of April 22 — two cohorts, each attending two full days on campus, three days online. Masks required all day. Six feet of distance. One-directional hallways. Class sizes halved. Teachers simultaneously addressing the room and a grid of laptop screens (simulcast). It doesn't feel like school — it feels like school cosplay. You eat lunch socially distanced. You can't see anyone's face below the eyes. The specific strangeness of seeing faces you'd been watching on a screen for over a year suddenly in three dimensions. Everyone looks wrong. Everyone looks smaller.

Persefoni goes back for one reason. Not the education — she's a millionaire, school is irrelevant. Not the social life — she doesn't have one. She goes back for Kathleen. The return to in-person is the first time since September that she could see Kathleen with her own eyes, be in the same hallway, maybe catch her at the locker, maybe say the thing she's been drafting and deleting on her phone for seven months. The school building is the only place Kathleen can't digitally seal her out. Brick and mortar. A hallway with two people in it. A chance.

**Kathleen's locker is empty.** Not cleared-out-for-summer empty. Gone empty. Different lock, or no lock. Someone else's things, or nothing. Persefoni stares at it and the staring is the loneliest thing she's done since the unanswered texts — because the locker was the plan. The locker was supposed to be the hallway she was never in. And the hallway is here and Kathleen is not.

She asks someone. Carefully, casually, the Personality managing the asking so nobody sees the desperation underneath. "Kathleen Verellen? Is she in the other cohort?" A shrug. "I think she transferred. Or went online full-time. I don't know." The words land in her body, not her taxonomy. She doesn't catalog. She absorbs.

### Scene H — Kathleen's House
She drives to Kathleen's house. She knows the way — of course she knows the way, she's been there a thousand times, the bedroom where Sheepey was born, the bed where Kathleen bounced and said "do it again," the house that was the second-safest place in her world after her own. She parks on the street. She sits in the car for a long time.

She goes to the door. She knocks. Kathleen's parents answer — her mom, or her dad, or both. They are kind. They have always been kind. They don't slam the door. They don't yell. They look at Persefoni the way you look at someone you used to love having in your house and now can't let in, and the looking is worse than anger because it has sadness in it instead of heat.

"Kathleen can't come to the door." They won't elaborate. Not hostile — just closed. A wall made of kindness, which is the hardest kind to push against because you can't be angry at people who are being gentle while they shut you out. Persefoni stands on the porch of the house where everything started and the door is a wall and the wall is soft and the softness is final.

She asks if Kathleen is okay. They say she's okay. They don't say more. She can feel the conversation ending — the polite, kind, Southern-adjacent ending of a conversation that was over before it started. She says "can you tell her I came by?" and they say they will and she knows it won't matter and she walks back to the car and sits in the car and the sitting is the last thing she does in Beaverton that matters.

The door is shut. Not by Kathleen — by the people who love Kathleen, who are protecting Kathleen from the girl who broke her. Persefoni can't even be angry at them. She'd do the same thing. She DID do the same thing — she let Alejandro tell Kathleen because she couldn't face it herself, and now Kathleen's parents are doing the same thing from the other side: standing between their daughter and the source of the pain.

She sees no way to get her friend back. The locker is empty. The house is a wall. The phone is a wall. Every door that used to lead to Kathleen is sealed, and the sealing is gentle, and the gentleness is permanent.

### Scene I — "The Free State of Florida" / She Never Comes Back (Late May 2021)
Démion got drafted by Tampa Bay on April 29 — first overall, like everyone knew he would. He's in Tampa now, the city throwing itself at his feet, the whole state of Florida buzzing with the arrival of the next greatest player who ever lived. He talks about it on their late-night calls — "the free state of Florida," he calls it, half-joking, half-serious, the way Florida felt in 2021 to someone coming from anywhere else: no mask mandates, restaurants open, beaches open, life happening at full volume while the rest of the country was still in half-measures. The opposite of Beaverton. The opposite of sealed rooms and filtered air and smoke and ice and the slow suffocation of a life that has contracted to nothing.

School is useless. She's a millionaire. She doesn't need the diploma. The education was never the point — Kathleen was the point, and Kathleen is behind a wall of gentle parents and an empty locker and seven months of unanswered texts. Alejandro is still in the blue-lit studio, still building frameworks, still thinking he's in a love story. Still thinking the physical intimacy will come when she's ready. Still waiting for a beginning that already ended.

Démion says come visit. The ease of it — the way he says it, like the distance between Oregon and Florida is nothing, like geography is a suggestion, like the world bends for people like them. She books a flight. She tells Alejandro she's going to visit a friend in Florida. She tells herself the same thing.

She goes to Tampa in late May. She does not come back. She buys a three-million-dollar condo in St. Pete.

Not dramatically. Not with a goodbye. Not with a scene or a confrontation or a text that says "it's over." She just doesn't come back. She buys a place — a three-million-dollar condo in St. Petersburg, cash, eighteen years old, the way only a millionaire teenager with no one to answer to can buy a place. The return flight sits unused. Her bedroom in Beaverton stays the way she left it — fairy lights repositioned for the camera, the set of a life she walked out of. She doesn't walk at graduation. She doesn't bother to graduate. She is eighteen years old and a millionaire and famous and the only person she wanted to see in Beaverton won't see her, so there is nothing in Beaverton, and Démion is in Tampa, and St. Pete is warm and loud and open and the opposite of everything that has been suffocating her for nine months.

She leaves the way Kathleen left — without announcement, without a scene. The symmetry is invisible to her. Kathleen stopped answering. Persefoni stops coming back. Two girls who loved each other, each disappearing from the other's life through a door that closes without slamming. The quietest departures are the most permanent.

Alejandro will find out the way he finds out everything — by observing the data and building a framework for it. But that's 1.12. This chapter ends with Persefoni on a plane to Tampa, the Beaverton rain on the window behind her, the life raft dissolving in her wake, and ahead of her the sun and the heat and a man who is 6'6" and wants her and doesn't need to explain why.

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not a breakup chapter. There's nothing to break up. Persefoni was never in a relationship with Alejandro — he was. She just doesn't come back from Florida. The not-relationship doesn't end with a conversation. It ends with an empty return flight. That's worse than a breakup because a breakup requires both people to have been in the same thing.
- It's not Alejandro's fault. He's doing everything right — by his framework. He's tender, devoted, strategic, patient about the sex. The problem isn't his effort. The problem is the foundation: a misread, a single night mistaken for a beginning, a girl who's in his studio because his brain makes her money and his HEPA filter makes the air breathable.
- It's not a love story with Démion. The DM, the calls, the visit — these are the Personality's answer, not the Scientist's. She doesn't leave Alejandro for Démion. She leaves Beaverton because Kathleen is behind a wall and school is useless and the life she's living has contracted to nothing. Démion is the door, not the reason. The reason is the empty locker and the kind parents who won't let her in.
- It's not an indictment of fame. The fame is the context, not the villain. The villain — if there is one — is the mechanism: private things going public, families becoming copies, the Cult of Personality's engine turning everything authentic into content.
- It's not about graduation. She doesn't bother. She doesn't need the diploma. She's eighteen and a millionaire and the only thing school could have given her — proximity to Kathleen — is gone. The not-graduating is the tell: nothing in Beaverton matters to her anymore except the one person who won't see her.

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)

- Something about the sky being the color of what she did — red, the Master's color, but poisoned
- Something about the smoke getting in through the cracks the way the guilt gets in through the cracks
- "I can't breathe at my house" — true, and also not the truth
- The moment the smoke clears and she's still suffocating — that's when she knows the smoke was never the problem
- The HEPA filter humming in his blue room — the Emissary's technology making the air breathable, making itself necessary
- A Sheepey story she would have told Kathleen — something about Salisbury, something about Victorian horses — and there's nobody to tell it to
- "Kathleen can't come to the door." — the kindest, most final sentence in the chapter. A wall made of gentleness.
- Something about the empty locker — not cleared-out-for-summer empty. Gone empty. The plan that was supposed to be the hallway she was never in.
- Something about the difference between a million exclamation marks from strangers and one from Kathleen
- "She'll be okay" — Alejandro's analgesic, the framework applied to Kathleen's pain, and Persefoni accepting it because the truth would capsize the boat
- Something about fairy lights repositioned for the camera — the same lights, different purpose, warmth becoming set design
- The life raft image — gripping vs. being held, desperation vs. rest
- The transaction: he builds her brand, she lets him believe they're together. He's literally making her money. She's literally making him feel chosen. One of them read the terms. The other thinks it's a love story.
- It happened once. The Stone-HENGE night. It is never happening again. She knows this the morning after. As if hell landed and caused it and when hell receded she disowned it.
- He never asks. He just tries — a hand on her lower back, leaning in, brushing her hair behind her ear — and she redirects, and he pulls back with the look of a kid who just got gently reprimanded without anyone raising their voice.
- She never says no. She just opens a different door — every time, so smoothly he doesn't realize he's been redirected until the moment has passed.
- He thinks they're in a private love story with a slow physical start. She knows there is no love story.
- Something about performing Sheepey for strangers and the laughter filling the wrong shape
- The cover-by-the-original-artist image: technically perfect, emotionally one degree off
- "One sees copies. The other sees families." — applied to the merch conversation, the sheep becoming inventory again
- Something about the hollowness not caring about metrics
- Something about ash on the car windshield every morning — the residue of things that burned, the evidence of destruction arriving gently
- The birthday cake with uneven frosting — Rosemary made it herself, three layers, the effort visible in the imperfection. The last real cake. The last birthday with George.
- Something about the empty chair that isn't empty — Alejandro is sitting in it, Alejandro brought flowers, Alejandro is being perfect — and the chair is still Kathleen-empty
- George grilling in November, narrating: "My baby girl is eighteen. Legal. A grown woman." Saying it like he's hosting a show. The pride that sounds like love.
- The elephant shirt — faded, too small, the shirt she'd never post on Instagram because it belongs to the version of her that existed before the camera. She puts it on without thinking. Muscle memory. Home.
- George on the couch: "Look at this kid, look at this KID" — slapping the armrest, in love the way men are in love with the man who brings their team glory. Pure and uncomplicated and total.
- Persefoni watching the same player, seeing something else entirely — his arms, his ass when he drops back, that smile after the touchdown. Transfixed. The most beautiful thing she's ever seen.
- The not-looking-him-up on Instagram — thirteen games, months of watching, and she never once searched his name. The restraint a tell, the not-looking a form of looking.
- The SEC Championship (52-46): the closest game of the season, George on his feet for the fourth quarter, Persefoni screaming next to him, and Démion throws the go-ahead touchdown and something turns over in her chest that has nothing to do with the score.
- "Roll Tide" / "Roll Damn Tide" — the phrase leaving the living room and entering the phone lines, the network of Black men from Alabama. George being purely, simply happy. Persefoni loving him so much it hurts.
- Alejandro doesn't do football. Alejandro doesn't understand the couch, the blanket, the elephant shirt. This is the one room he can't enter — not because he's excluded, because he doesn't have the vocabulary.
- The DM from Démion — something about the difference between what she felt reading his message and what she's felt for months in Alejandro's bed. Want. The word she couldn't find because she'd never had it and didn't know it was missing.
- Something about his size — 6'6", 250, the physical opposite of Alejandro in every dimension. The body as a fact the Emissary can't narrate away.
- "The free state of Florida" — Démion's phrase, half-joking, the pull of a place where everything is open and nothing is sealed
- Something about not coming back — the return flight sitting unused, the bedroom staying the way she left it, the fairy lights still positioned for the camera in a room nobody's filming in
- She leaves the way Kathleen left — without announcement, without a scene. The symmetry invisible to her.

## What This Chapter Does

1. COVID lockdown compresses the triangle into screens. School goes remote. The world shrinks to bedrooms and Wi-Fi and the three of them on FaceTime, except the three of them aren't equal anymore — two of them are building empires from their bedrooms and the third is watching.
2. Sergey helps Persephone evolve her brand — moving her identity (the Sheepey side, the storyteller, the mind) onto Instagram while TikTok stays pure dance. He gives her the framework: TikTok is the body, Instagram is the voice. The Emissary structuring the Master's expression.
3. The creative partnership deepens into something gravitational. Late nights in his studio, building her content together, his analytical mind shaping her instinctive voice into something the platform can hold.
4. Kathleen is supportive, present, warm — and in the back seat. She watches her boyfriend help her best friend become someone the world can see. She says "that's amazing, babe" and means it. The gap widens.
5. The chapter ends with the betrayal: Sergey plays Persephone a song he wrote about her — "Stone-HENGE," sung from Sheepey's perspective, the stuffed sheep thanking Persephone for giving him life. It's the inverse of Virtue the Cat (the Weakerthans song that split the triangle in 1.1/1.2): Virtue lost her name, Sheepey gained his. The song is romantic, intimate, and silly simultaneously — Sheepey trying to say "you made me real" while maintaining his dignity. It's devastating. Sergey creates it live, layer by layer, in front of her. She feels seen in a way nobody has seen her since before the fame. She has been so lonely inside the description the world built around her. And he saw through it, all the way back to the girl with the stuffed sheep. She is breathless. He reads her reaction as attraction. They sleep together.
6. **The misread at the heart of the betrayal:** Persephone felt *seen* by her best friend. Sergey read *desire* from the girl he's wanted since she first said something that cut through his entire framework. She was experiencing communion — the relief of being known. He was experiencing confirmation — the moment the data finally supported his hypothesis. The Emissary classifying the Master's tears as an invitation.

## The Core Tragedy

The betrayal isn't about lust. It isn't about Persephone choosing Sergey over Kathleen. It's about **loneliness meeting misrecognition.**

Persephone has spent months inside a version of herself built by strangers. Girl-next-door charm. America's sweetheart. The girl in the fairy lights. The description grew louder and the person inside it grew quieter. Her dad narrates her fame as his story. Her mom worries from a distance. Kathleen holds the phone and says "perfect" and means the video, not the girl. The internet sees her face and not her mind. She has been *unseen* — truly, fundamentally unseen — for months.

Then Sergey builds a song about a drunk sheep from Stonehenge. And it's perfect. And it's her. And for the first time in months, someone is looking at the part of her the camera can't see.

She doesn't want to sleep with him. She wants to be *known.* But the wanting-to-be-known is so intense and so raw and so physically overwhelming that when he leans in, she doesn't stop him. Not because she desires him. Because the seeing felt like being touched and the touching felt like more seeing and the line between them dissolved before she could find it.

The Emissary's misread: he has wanted her for years — since before England, since the first time she said something that made his whole system stutter. He has cataloged this wanting, filed it, managed it, sublimated it into music. When she cries at his song — when her whole body responds to being seen — he reads the response through his own wanting. She is moved; he reads attraction. She is grateful; he reads desire. She is overwhelmed; he reads yes.

He's not wrong that she participated. He's wrong about *why.*

## COVID Lockdown — The Compression

### March 2020
Schools close. Classes go remote. The world that was already shrinking — the triangle already self-contained, already more interesting to each other than anyone else — contracts to the size of screens.

Persephone's bedroom becomes her studio full-time. The fairy lights. The tripod. The phone. She posts daily, sometimes twice. TikTok numbers keep climbing — lockdown is rocket fuel for a solo content creator who can produce from her bedroom. Everyone is home, everyone is on their phones, everyone is watching.

Sergey's bedroom studio is already built for isolation. The loop station, the laptop, Ableton. He was made for this moment — a solo artist who needs nothing but a room and a signal chain. His music keeps coming. The Spotify numbers climb.

Kathleen's bedroom is just a bedroom. She doesn't create. She doesn't produce. She supports. And support, in lockdown, means texting "that's amazing!" and watching from across town. The physical proximity that kept her central — sitting on Persephone's bed, holding the phone, being in the room — is gone. The tripod replaced her hands. The screen replaced her presence. She's the girl who held the phone, and the phone doesn't need holding anymore.

And she can't sneak out. Kathleen's parents are strict — the kind of strict that means lockdown is *lockdown,* that means the front door is monitored, that means a teenager stays in her house when the world says stay in your house. Persephone's parents are doing their own thing — George and Rosemary are loose enough, distracted enough, that a daughter slipping out at night doesn't register. Sergey's parents — Dr. Oscar Feldman and his mother, both academics, both loving him abstractly — are too self-absorbed and aloof to notice their son has a visitor at midnight. The geometry of the betrayal is partly parenting: one girl locked in, one girl free to roam, one boy whose parents don't check.

### The Geometry Shifts
Before lockdown, the three of them existed in physical space — the lunch table, the bedroom, the car. Kathleen's body in the room was her claim on the triangle. She was *there.* She was the warm hand on Sergey's arm, the head on Persephone's shoulder, the girl between two spotlights who belonged in the light because she was standing in it.

Lockdown removes the body. What's left is function. And functionally, Persephone and Sergey are the two who make things. They're the two whose bedrooms are studios. They're the two the world is watching. Kathleen is the audience now — the most loving, most loyal audience, but audience.

## The Brand Pivot — Sergey's Architecture

### The Problem Persephone Can Feel But Can't Name
The internet Persephone — dance, beauty, smile, fairy lights — is a pressed flower. She knows this. She felt it in 1.7 — the off-ness, the crookedness, the picture hanging slightly wrong. The description doesn't match the person. But she doesn't know how to fix it because the thing the description is missing (the mind, the storyteller, the girl who makes you cry with a princess riff) doesn't fit in a thirty-second dance video.

### Sergey Sees It
He's been watching. Classifying. Doing what Sergey does — taking the phenomenon apart to understand its architecture. And he sees the gap: TikTok Persephone is all body. The mind — the thing that made her extraordinary, the thing that made "Careless" land, the thing the castle princess did — isn't on camera.

He says something like: "You're giving them the dance. You're not giving them the voice."

And he's right. The Emissary diagnosing the Master's problem with surgical precision. The same boy who said "parasocial eye contact" at the lunch table now saying something that actually matters: *the platform is eating the interesting parts of you.*

### The Instagram Strategy
TikTok stays dance. That's where the numbers are. That's where the algorithm found her and that's where it keeps her.

Instagram becomes something else. Sergey helps her build it — not the aesthetic (she has her own eye) but the structure. What to post. How to frame her voice. How to let the storyteller out without losing the audience that came for the dancer.

The content evolves: short-form videos where she *talks.* Not dances — talks. The kind of observations Persephone makes naturally — the things she says in the car, at dinner, in the spaces between performing. The Sheepey sensibility softened for a public audience. Her take on things. Stories. Riffs. The mind behind the dancer, finally on camera.

It works. Of course it works. The same quality the camera catches in her dance — the *presence*, the sense of being addressed — is even more potent when she's speaking. The parasocial eye contact Sergey identified at the lunch table, combined with the thing he couldn't classify: a voice that makes you feel like she's talking to *you.* Not performing for an audience. Talking to you. The same trick. The same gift. Now with words.

The Instagram grows fast. Different audience than TikTok — slightly older, slightly more engaged, the kind of followers who watch and rewatch and care. Persephone is becoming a brand with depth. A person, not just a face.

Sergey built the architecture. She filled it with herself.

### What This Costs Kathleen
Kathleen was the audience of one before the audience of millions. She was the girl who saw Persephone before anyone else did. Now Sergey is the one who sees her — sees the gap between the description and the person, sees what's missing, helps her fill it.

Kathleen's role was *seeing.* Now someone else sees better. Not more lovingly. Not more loyally. Just more *usefully.* Sergey's seeing comes with a framework, a strategy, a way to translate being-seen into being-seen-by-millions. Kathleen's seeing was private and total and had no output. Love without function.

Kathleen says: "The new posts are incredible." She means it. She doesn't see that the new posts are incredible because Sergey understood something about Persephone that Kathleen never needed to understand — because Kathleen already knew it, had always known it, but knowing wasn't enough. You had to build something with the knowing. And building was Sergey's gift.

## The Late Nights — Working Together

### The Studio Sessions
Persephone sneaks out. Lockdown is still lockdown — her parents don't know she's leaving the house. She starts coming to Sergey's bedroom studio — the loop station, the laptop, the cables, the blue glow of screens. They work on her Instagram content together. He helps her structure her thoughts. She says things and he shapes them. She arrives at the idea and he builds the room for it.

These sessions run late. Midnight. 1 AM. 2 AM. They're in the blue light of his monitors — his territory, his color — and she's bringing the warmth with her, the red-gold of fairy lights replaced by something more direct, more physical: her presence in his space. Two kids making something together in the dark.

The conversation ranges. Always does, with them. McGilchrist. Music. The fame. The weird loneliness of being watched by millions. He understands this — he's experiencing his own version. The two of them are the only two people in Beaverton, possibly the only two people their age anywhere, who know what this specific thing feels like. The compression of lockdown plus the expansion of fame plus the isolation of being seventeen and extraordinary.

They talk about things they don't talk about with Kathleen. Not because they're excluding her. Because Kathleen doesn't have the reference points. She isn't famous. She isn't creating. She isn't inside the machine. The conversations Persephone and Sergey have — about what it means to be seen by strangers, about the gap between the description and the person, about the loneliness of being the most-watched version of yourself — are conversations Kathleen can't enter. Not because she's not smart enough. Because she hasn't lived it.

The intimacy of shared experience. The Emissary and the Master finding common ground in the specific suffering of being visible.

### What Persephone Notices
She notices the hours. She notices that she's choosing his studio over her bedroom, his blue light over her fairy lights, his company over Kathleen's FaceTime calls. She notices and she files it and she doesn't name it because naming it would make it a thing and she doesn't want it to be a thing. It's just work. They're just working. He helps her with her brand and she listens to his new tracks and they talk and the talking goes late and it's just two friends who happen to be building empires side by side.

She notices Kathleen's texts arriving while she's in Sergey's studio. *Hey, what are you up to?* And she types back *working on stuff with Sergey* and the reply comes: *oh fun! tell him I said hi!* And the exclamation marks are Kathleen — cheerful, supportive, the girl who says "do it again" with the same excitement the second time as the first. The exclamation marks don't falter. The support doesn't waver. Kathleen is the most consistent thing in her life and Persephone is in someone else's bedroom at midnight and the consistency should feel like an anchor and instead it feels like distance.

She doesn't want it to feel like distance. She wants Kathleen on the bed, cross-legged, holding the phone. She wants the bouncing and the screaming when the numbers tick over. She wants the girl who wrapped presents badly on purpose. And the worst part — the part that makes this a tragedy instead of a choice — is that Kathleen would be there. They would have her there. Persephone would open the door and Sergey would make room and the triangle would hold. But Kathleen can't get out. Her parents' house is sealed. The strict parents who check the doors and count the hours have their daughter locked inside a lockdown within the lockdown, and Kathleen can't climb out the window the way Persephone can, can't slip past parents who aren't paying attention the way Persephone does, because Kathleen's parents *are* paying attention. The geometry isn't changing because anyone chose to change it. It's changing because one girl's parents are strict and another girl's aren't, and that accident of parenting is enough to redraw a triangle into a line.

## "Stone-HENGE" — The Song

### The Setup
A late night. Deep into lockdown. September. The trees outside Sergey's window are starting to turn — summer passed while nobody was looking, while everyone was inside. Six months of this. Six months of sealed houses and screens and the world contracted to bedrooms. Persephone is on his bed (the only place to sit that isn't the desk chair) and he's at the loop station, and the blue light of the monitors gives the room that quality — cerebral, cool, the Emissary's color.

He says something like: "I made something. It's not — I don't know if it works. But I made it for you."

She's heard his songs before. She's heard "Careless" and known it was about them. She's heard "Enough to See By" and known it was about the yurt. But those songs were coded — the references hidden inside metaphor, the personal buried under production. This is different. He tells her it's for her. He's going to build it live.

### The Song — The Inverse of Virtue the Cat
"Stone-HENGE." The title is a pun — Stone-HENGE, emphasis on the second syllable, the way Persephone says "Stonehenge" when she's doing Sheepey. The way she's always said it. The way only the three of them say it.

**The Virtue the Cat echo:** In 1.1/1.2, the Weakerthans song "Virtue the Cat Explains Her Departure" split the triangle open. A cat who left home and lost "the sound that you found for me" — her name, her identity, the self someone else gave her. Persephone couldn't speak. Kathleen thought it was cute. The gap between what they heard was six feet wide. "Stone-HENGE" is the *inverse* of Virtue. Virtue is about a creature who *lost* the name someone loved her with. Sheepey is about a creature who *gained* one. Virtue departs. Sheepey arrives. Virtue's question is "who am I without you?" Sheepey's question is "who would I be if you hadn't seen me?" Both are animals narrating with total sincerity. Both are devastating underneath the comedy. Both do the thing Persephone does — characters who say the things the person can't say straight.

He starts with the loop station. The click of the pedal. The first loop: a plucked sound, simple, almost like a music box. Something delicate and slightly wobbly, like a lullaby played by someone who's had a few.

Then his voice. And his voice is doing something she has never heard him do — he's singing in the Sheepey voice. Not imitating Persephone doing Sheepey. *Doing* Sheepey. The slightly posh, slightly drunk, deeply dignified sheep from Stonehenge who has opinions about everything and feelings about nothing (except when he does, except when the feelings arrive sideways, through a comment about landscape or history or the quality of the grass).

The Sheepey voice coming out of Sergey's loop station is — she can't process it. Nobody does Sheepey except her and Kathleen. Nobody else has ever tried. Nobody else knows Sheepey well enough to try. And Sergey is doing it *perfectly.* Not a parody. Not a tribute. He has absorbed the character — cataloged every inflection, every pause, every moment where Sheepey's dignity cracks and something real comes through — and he's singing it. The Emissary cataloged the Master's creation so precisely that he can reproduce it. The question is whether reproducing it is the same as understanding it.

**The song is sung from Sheepey's perspective.** Sheepey is addressing Persephone directly — the girl who picked him up in the gift shop and decided he was someone. The song is romantic and intimate and silly all at once, the way only Sheepey can be: deeply sincere feelings delivered through the voice of a drunk stuffed animal who would rather die than admit he has feelings.

The structure — what the song is actually about:

- **Sheepey before Persephone:** A sheep on a shelf. A gift shop item. Price tag and polyester and a face stitched on by a machine in a factory. He was nothing. Not nobody — nothing. He didn't exist as a self. He was inventory. He was a copy. (The Emissary's word — "one sees copies.")
- **The moment she picked him up:** She looked at him and he became someone. Not gradually. Instantly. The way she does everything — she arrived at the thing and the thing was real. She held him and said something (the first Sheepey line, whatever it was, lost to time) and in that moment a seven-dollar stuffed sheep acquired a name, a voice, a backstory, a drinking problem, a complicated relationship with modernity, and dignity. She gave him *life.* Not metaphorically. She looked at a copy and saw a family. (The Master's word — "the other sees families.")
- **Sheepey's gratitude:** This is the heart of the song. Sheepey is grateful. Profoundly, embarrassingly, undignifiedly grateful — which is a problem because dignity is all he has. He tries to say thank you the way Sheepey says everything — through indirection, through complaints about the weather and observations about the stones and commentary on the state of modern sheep. But the thank you keeps leaking through. The posh voice cracks. The dignity falters. The stuffed animal who was nothing before a girl looked at him tries to tell her what she did, what she gave him, what it means to go from inventory to *person* because someone decided you were one.
- **The silly and the devastating coexist:** Lines that are funny ("I was situated between a rather inferior tea towel and a snow globe of questionable taste") sit next to lines that are heartbreaking ("You held me and I heard my name for the first time"). The comedy doesn't undercut the emotion. The emotion doesn't kill the comedy. They live together the way they live in Persephone — the girl who builds a character about a drunk sheep and means every word.

Layer by layer, the song builds. The Sheepey vocal loops over itself — one voice becoming a choir, each layer adding a new dimension of the same grateful, slightly-inebriated, desperately-dignified sheep trying to say the unsayable: *you made me real.* The pulsing beat underneath — that Animal Collective primal throb — turns what should be comedy into something that hits your chest. The humor is there. The absurdity is there. The love is there. The three coexist because that's what Sheepey IS — ridiculous and real and full of feeling he'd rather you didn't notice.

**What the song is really saying — the thing underneath the sheep:** *You give things life. That's your gift. You look at things and they become real. You looked at a stuffed animal and gave him a soul. You looked at a castle and gave it a princess. You look at a camera and ten million people feel seen. But nobody sees YOU. Nobody thanks the girl who gives everything life for the life she gives. Nobody holds the mirror up to the mirror. This is me, holding the mirror. This is me, the boy who catalogs everything, telling you: I cataloged what you do and it's the most extraordinary thing I've ever observed. You make things real by seeing them. Let me see you.*

That's what Sergey wrote. That's what Persephone hears. That's why she can't breathe.

### Persephone's Response
She can't breathe.

Not dramatically — she doesn't gasp or cry or make a scene. She just stops breathing. The way you stop breathing when something arrives that your body receives before your mind can classify it. A gathering. An opening. Her arms don't cross. Her eyes don't close. Everything opens.

Because he *sees* her. The real her. Not the dance, not the face, not the fairy lights, not the parasocial eye contact, not the girl-next-door charm. The girl with the sheep. The girl who talks in a posh voice about a stuffed animal and means every word. The girl who builds characters because characters can say the things she can't. The girl whose best, truest, most alive self is the self that's invisible to everyone except the people who were in the car, at the stones, in the gift shop when a seven-dollar stuffed sheep became a person.

She has been so lonely. The fame is lonely. The description is lonely. Being watched by millions of people who see your face and not your mind is the loneliest thing she has ever experienced, lonelier than the yurt, lonelier than lying still in the dark. At least in the yurt someone was in the room. The fame put her in a room with ten million people and none of them could see her.

And Sergey just saw her. With a loop station and a pun and a drunk sheep.

Her eyes are wet. Her chest is tight. She is looking at him across the blue-lit room and he is looking at her and the song is still looping — the sheep choir, the pulse, the thing he built for her — and she feels *known.* Known the way she was known before the fame, before the description, before the pressed flower. Known the way Kathleen knew her once, in the bedroom with the fairy lights, before knowing needed an output.

This is not desire. This is relief. This is the feeling of a door opening in a wall she didn't know was there. This is the loneliest girl in Beaverton being handed back the part of herself the internet couldn't see.

### The Misread
Sergey sees her face. The wet eyes. The open mouth. The body that has gone completely still — not the stillness of the yurt, the protective stillness, but a different stillness, the stillness of being overwhelmed by being seen.

And he reads it as wanting him.

He has wanted her since the first time she said something perceptive — since she opened her mouth and the thing that came out reorganized his entire framework. Since the castle, the staircase, the princess who unmade his system. He has wanted her through "Careless" and "Enough to See By" and every late night in this studio and every conversation about fame and loneliness and the gap between the description and the person. He has filed this wanting. He has managed it. He has been loyal to Kathleen — genuinely, effortfully loyal, the way the Emissary does everything: with discipline and structure and a system that held.

But the system has been eroding. The late nights. The shared understanding. The way she looks at him when he says something that cuts through to exactly what she's feeling. The creative intimacy that feels like another kind of intimacy. And now she's sitting on his bed with tears in her eyes because of something he made and the system breaks.

He leans toward her. Or she leans toward him. Or the distance between them closes without either of them deciding. From Persephone's POV: his face is suddenly close. His mouth. The blue light on his skin. And the feeling of being seen is so enormous and so physical and so indistinguishable from being touched that when he kisses her she doesn't stop him.

She doesn't stop him. That's not the same as wanting him to start.

### After
They sleep together. In his bedroom. On his bed. With the loop station still on, the last track still loaded, "Stone-HENGE" still looping in the headphones that slipped off the desk and are playing to nobody — the sheep choir singing to an empty room while two people cross a line on the other side of the blue light.

It's different from the yurt. In the yurt, Sergey was with Kathleen, and Persephone held still. This time Persephone is with Sergey, and Kathleen is across town, texting exclamation marks, and nobody holds still.

She doesn't think about Kathleen while it happens. That's the worst part — the part she'll carry for years, the part that will surface in Act 3 when the Scientist learns to observe without narrating. She doesn't think about her best friend. Not once. The loneliness was so big and the being-seen was so total that it swallowed everything else. The triangle, the line, the princess riff, the patch she built at Chepstow — all of it dissolved in the feeling of being known by someone who could also touch her.

Afterward. Lying in the blue light. The monitors still on. The loop station still humming. His hand on her arm and his breathing going even and the room that was his studio is now something else — a crime scene, a confession booth, the place where the triangle finally broke.

She thinks about Kathleen.

Not with guilt. Not yet. Guilt comes later, comes in waves, comes with a specificity that will take her apart. Right now she thinks about Kathleen the way you think about a sound you heard a long time ago and can't quite place. Kathleen on the bed. Kathleen holding the phone. Kathleen's wide eyes on the playback. "That one." "Perfect." "Do it again."

She stares at the ceiling. It's the wrong ceiling. It's not her bedroom with the fairy lights and the red-gold glow. It's Sergey's ceiling, blue-white from the monitors, cool and cerebral. She is in the Emissary's room. She got here by being seen and she stayed by being touched and now Kathleen's best friend and Kathleen's boyfriend are lying in Kathleen's boyfriend's bed and the sheep is still singing to nobody.

The chapter ends here. The same moment, from the other side of the bed, begins 1.10.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Stone** | "Stone-HENGE" — the title itself. Stonehenge as the origin point of Sheepey, of the triangle, of everything. The stones that were built to be listened to but everyone just looks at — and now Sergey has finally *listened.* Stone as what endures vs. what holds you in place. |
| **Wind** | Absent. Lockdown seals the windows. The air doesn't move. Persephone is in rooms with no wind — her bedroom, his studio, sealed boxes with screens and blue light. The Master has no wind in this chapter. She's trapped in stone. |
| **Blue** | Sergey's studio. The monitors. The Emissary's color, his territory, where it happens. Persephone is in his blue room, not her red-gold one. She crossed into his territory. The blue light on his skin when he leans in. |
| **Red** | The fairy lights she left behind. Her bedroom — warm, red-gold, *hers.* She isn't in it. The red is absent from the betrayal. The Master's color left at home. |
| **The Gap** | The gap between what Persephone felt (being seen) and what Sergey read (desire). The same gap as Virtue the Cat, as "Careless," as every moment where two people hear the same thing and hear completely different things. Except this time the gap produces a body in a bed. |
| **Wind/Stillness** | In the yurt, Persephone held still to protect Kathleen. Here she doesn't hold still. The movement — the not-holding-still — is the betrayal. |
| **Virtue / Sheepey** | The structural echo: Virtue the Cat lost "the sound that you found for me" — identity given, then lost. Sheepey gained it — identity given, held, celebrated. Virtue departs; Sheepey arrives. Both narrated by animals with total sincerity. The song that split the triangle apart (Virtue, in 1.1) is answered by the song that breaks it forever (Stone-HENGE, here). |
| **Copies / Families** | "One sees copies. The other sees families." Sheepey was a copy — inventory, price tag, stitched face. Persephone looked at him and saw a family member. The song is about the moment a copy becomes a person. The Master's gift, named by the Emissary's framework. |

## Threads Planted

- **The misread as the foundation of the relationship.** Everything that follows — 1.11's "famous couple," 1.12's "Emissary with everything he wanted" — is built on Sergey's wrong reading. He thinks she chose him. She was drowning and he was the closest surface.
- **Kathleen's exclamation marks.** The texts arriving while Persephone is in his studio. The support that never wavers. The consistency that becomes distance. These texts will haunt Persephone later.
- **"Stone-HENGE" as evidence.** The song proves Sergey can see the real her. But seeing someone and understanding what they need from being seen are different things. He saw her perfectly and responded to what he saw completely wrong.
- **The loneliness of fame.** This chapter names it — being watched by millions who see your face and not your mind. This becomes the central problem of Acts 1-2, the thing the retreat finally solves.
- **The gaslighting chain.** George narrated Rosemary. Sergey narrated Kathleen. Now Sergey narrates Persephone — reading her emotional response through his wanting, overwriting "I feel seen" with "she wants me." Same mechanism. Different victims.
- **The color swap.** Persephone left her red-gold room for his blue one. She crossed into the Emissary's territory. The betrayal happens in blue light, not red. Stone, not wind.

---

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not a romance. Persephone doesn't fall for Sergey. She falls into relief and the relief becomes physical and the physical becomes a thing she can't take back.
- It's not Persephone's fault more than Sergey's, or vice versa. The tragedy is the misread — two people in the same moment experiencing completely different things.
- It's not planned or calculated by either of them. The Emissary's system breaks; the Master's loneliness overflows. Neither chose this. Both did it.
- It's not about sex. It's about being seen. The sex is a consequence of the seeing, not the point of the seeing.

---

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)

- Something about the sheep choir singing to an empty room while two people cross a line
- The fairy lights she left at home — her color, absent
- Kathleen's exclamation marks arriving in the blue light
- "I made something for you" — the most dangerous sentence
- The difference between holding still (the yurt) and not holding still (here)
- The ceiling — the wrong ceiling, the wrong color, the wrong room
- Being seen is not the same as being wanted, but the body can't tell the difference
- The tripod replaced Kathleen's hands; Sergey replaced Kathleen's eyes

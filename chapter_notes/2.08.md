# Chapter 2.08 — TBD Title

**POV:** Démion (third person limited)
**Setting:** Santa Monica (Persefoni's house) / Chargers facility / Gulfport briefly
**Time span:** Six months. November 2026 through ~May 2027. Démion is 25.
**Timeline:** Overlaps and follows 2.07. George's death from Démion's side, then the long vigil.

**Epigraph:** "When there's no way out / I'll let you build your home in me 'til the clocks run down / When your luck's run out / Call me and I will come and fix you, get your feet on the ground / When there's no way out / Call me and I will come and bury you, all safe and sound" — Electric President, "Safe and Sound"

**Prose status:** First draft complete

**Tone:** Vigil. The sustained, unglamorous act of watching over someone through darkness. Quiet, domestic, interior. The world shrunk to the size of a living room. Television light. The hum of a house where no one opens the curtains. What makes it specifically a Démion vigil: a man built for explosive action — the field, the crowd, the spectacular body doing spectacular things — and his assignment is *stillness*. Stay on the couch. Be warm. Don't leave. The most difficult thing the body has ever been asked to do is nothing.

## What This Chapter Does

1. **Football takes a backseat.** This is the single most important thing about this chapter. For the first time in Démion Reyes's life — the first time since he could run, since he could throw, since the body became the instrument and the instrument became the identity — football is not the first thing. Persefoni is the first thing.

   **The Sunday.** George died Saturday evening at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama. La called Démion Saturday night — he knew before the sun came up. He knew before the game. He knew while Persefoni was in the air, while La was flying from Orlando, while Rosemary was driving to Birmingham to pick up her daughter.

   He played anyway. The Cowboys game in Dallas, Sunday afternoon. He could have said the word — *my fiancée's father just died* — and no one would have questioned it. Jim Harbaugh would have nodded. The backup would have dressed. He played. The body did what the body did. The machine didn't stop because the machine had never stopped. The game was first, had always been first. One last time, the game was first.

   But the body knows something is wrong. There's a moment during the game — a play, a throw, a hesitation that doesn't belong. Something the body does that the mind can't explain. A pause. A misread. A ball thrown to a spot where no one is, or a snap where his hands don't move for a half-second too long, or a look toward the sideline at nothing. The announcers don't catch it. The coaches note it and forget it. But it's there — a glitch in the machine, a moment where the grief the mind won't process leaks through the body. The body that knows everything — it knows this too, and the knowing makes the hands imprecise.

   After the game, after the flight from Dallas, he walks into the hospital late Sunday night. And then: this isn't a decision. Démion doesn't sit down and think: *I'm going to put her before football.* The way Démion does everything, it just happens. The body knows. George is dead and something in Démion's body reorganizes — the same body that played a football game while her father's body cooled in a building across the state line — and the reorganization is total and immediate and doesn't require thought. She needs him. He is there. The game was one last confirmation that the game was first. And then the game wasn't first. The machine yielded — not immediately, not before one last game, but it yielded.

   The reader has never seen this Démion. Every chapter before this, football and Persefoni have been the twin drives — "football and her, her and football" — equal, parallel, the two things that organize his world. Now one of them is more. Now she is more. And the being-more is not a sacrifice. It's not Démion gritting his teeth and choosing love over sport. It's Démion discovering, without any framework for the discovery, that there is something in his body that responds to her pain with a force stronger than the force that responds to the game.

   He didn't know this about himself. He didn't know because he's never been tested. Peerlessness has never had to compete with compassion. The machine has never had to yield to the human. And now it yields — not because he wills it, but because the body that always tells him everything is telling him something new: she matters more.

2. **He moves in.** Démion moves into Persefoni's Santa Monica house. Not his Bel Air place — her place. The two-bedroom near the bluffs, the one she bought with her own money, her name, her space. The one thread she never let go of. He walks through the door with a bag and doesn't leave for six months.

   This is the physical fact of the chapter: 6'6", 250 lbs, living in a space built for a woman who is 5'8" and chose every piece of furniture herself. His body is too big for the couch. His shoulders don't fit the shower. His shoes by the door take up half the entryway. He fills her space the way George filled every space — by being too much for it, by making the rooms feel smaller. Except George's too-much was warmth and noise. Démion's too-much is body and silence.

   He drives to the Chargers facility for games. He drives back to her house after. The commute isn't geographic — it's between two identities. The stadium and the living room. The field and the couch where Pooh is playing. Every game day he leaves her house at dawn and comes back in the dark and the coming-back is the real thing, the game the interruption.

3. **He is her rock.** The physical reality of this. Démion at 6'6", 250 lbs, holding a woman who is trying to disappear. Because that's what Persefoni does — she wants to crawl under a blanket and stay there until the world agrees to go back to the way it was before. She wants to stop existing. Not die — just stop. Stop being a person in a world where her father isn't.

   And Démion doesn't let her. Not through words — Démion has never been good with words, has never needed to be. Through the body. He holds her. He picks her up when she won't get up. He puts food in front of her when she won't eat. He is physically present in a way that has nothing to do with performance and everything to do with the body's instinct: protect her. Keep her here. Don't let her vanish.

   This is the Démion the reader needs to love. This is the Démion who is genuinely good — not performing goodness, not being good because it confirms his narrative, but being good because his body is good at this. The same physical intelligence that makes him the greatest quarterback alive makes him the greatest partner in this specific crisis. He reads her body the way he reads a defense — instinctively, without analysis, the body knowing what the body needs. She needs to be held. He holds her. She needs to not be alone. He doesn't leave.

4. **He tries to be George.** This is the key. Démion steps into George's role — the big man, the warm presence, the one who fills the room so the women don't have to. But Démion fills rooms through *magnitude* — people recalibrate when he enters. George filled rooms through *warmth* — people relaxed when he entered. Démion can hold them, feed them, pick them up off the floor. He can't narrate them. He can't do the voice, the stories, the "BABY GIRL," the warmth that arrived before the man did.

   He tries. He brings food. He grills on the Santa Monica patio — not because he's a griller, but because George was, and someone needs to stand at the grill. He fixes things in the house — not because he's handy, but because George would have fixed them, and his body can do anything it decides to do. He does the physical things George did. But the soundtrack is missing. The rooms are warm but they're quiet. And Démion has never minded quiet — but he can feel that *they* mind it. They need the noise. George was noise. Démion is presence. The gap between presence and noise is the gap he can't close.

   The body discovers domestic competence the way it discovered athletic competence: immediately, completely, without instruction. He didn't know he could be this. He is this. But "this" is not George. "This" is a man trying to fill a George-shaped hole with a Démion-shaped body, and the shapes don't match, and the not-matching is not failure — it's the limit. He can be the rock. He can't be the weather.

5. **The domestic vigil.** The texture of six months inside a house with the curtains drawn.

   Persefoni and Rosemary watch Winnie the Pooh. They watch Mister Rogers. They watch the shows that sound like the voice they've lost — Pooh's warmth without complexity, kindness without agenda; Mister Rogers looking into the camera and saying "I like you just the way you are." These aren't random comfort shows. They're George substitutes. The women aren't watching children's television. They're listening for a voice that sounds like his.

   Through Démion's body-first POV: he doesn't name this. But he feels it. He notices that the crying pauses during certain scenes. He notices Rosemary's breathing change when Mister Rogers speaks. He sits on the couch with them and doesn't watch the screen — the screen isn't for him. He watches them watch it. And the body understands something the mind can't articulate: they need a gentleness he can't produce.

   They don't go outside. For weeks at a time, the front door doesn't open except for Démion leaving for games and coming back. The curtains stay drawn. The Pacific is fifty yards away and invisible. The Santa Monica light — the famous light, the golden California light that drew everyone here — doesn't enter the house. The house is television light: blue, flickering, the specific glow of animated shows playing to an audience that isn't watching for entertainment but for the sound of kindness.

   The crying comes out of nowhere. He's on the couch, Persefoni next to him, the episode playing, everything still — and then her body changes. A sound that starts in her chest before it reaches her mouth. He feels it before he hears it. She's crying and the crying has no trigger — no scene, no memory, no word that set it off. The grief just arrives, the way weather arrives, and his body responds the way it responds to everything: immediately, without thought. His arm goes around her. He pulls her in. He holds. And Rosemary on the other side of the couch starts too — grief is contagious in this house — and now he's holding two women and the episode is still playing and the bear is still talking about honey and the room smells like the inside of a house that hasn't been opened in weeks. This goes on for six months.

6. **The grief from his side.** Démion liked George. He genuinely liked George. Not loved — Démion's love is always filtered through the question of magnitude, of what someone represents — but liked, in the body's way. George was warm. George was big. George filled rooms the same way Démion fills rooms, and the recognition was real. George called after every game. George said "that's my boy" with the breathless pride of a man who had adopted Démion into his narrative. George was audience — the best kind, loud and uncritical — and Démion liked being in George's audience the way he liked being in everyone's audience.

   But it was more than audience. George was the father who chose him. Démion's own father confirmed him through athletics — the body's language, the same language Démion speaks. George confirmed him through warmth — the voice, the enthusiasm, the immediate total absorption of Démion into the family narrative. They needed a George and there's a part of Démion that needs one too. The big man who said "that's my boy" and meant it. The man who hugged him in the doorway like family.

   George is gone. And Démion feels it — not the way Persefoni feels it (the floor disappearing, the world ending), but the way Démion feels everything: physically. The absence of George's phone calls. The silence where the big voice used to be. After every game for years — every single game — George called. Now Démion finishes a game and checks his phone and the call isn't there. The silence where the voice used to be. He doesn't grieve this the way Persefoni does. He notices it the way the body notices a missing tooth — the tongue keeps going to the space. His thumb hovers over the phone after games. The body expecting the thing that isn't coming.

   He grieves George as an absence — a shape removed from the world, a volume turned down. The grief is real and it's shallow and the shallowness isn't cruelty — it's the architecture of a man who experiences the world through the body. The body misses George. The body doesn't know what to do with the missing.

7. **Rosemary.** Rosemary is discharged from St. Vincent's Birmingham and can't go home. The bungalow in Gulfport is George's house — every room is George, the porch, the grill, the coffee maker, the newspaper on the table. She can't be in those rooms. So she's in Persefoni's guest room in Santa Monica. Small, diminished, the blonde hair unwashed, the trying-smile gone. The mirror without the thing it mirrors.

   Démion sees the woman who has always been George's mirror — petite, sweet, trying — now in his fiancée's guest room, watching Mister Rogers at 2 PM on a Tuesday, crying into a blanket. He doesn't fully understand Rosemary. He's never understood people who need other people the way Rosemary needed George. He considers himself self-sufficient (peerless, complete, the man who doesn't need). But he sits in the living room with Rosemary because Persefoni can't sit there alone, and sitting is what you do when someone you love is drowning.

   What he sees in Rosemary and doesn't name: the danger. A woman whose entire identity was organized around one person, and the person is gone, and the identity collapses so completely that the body follows. He doesn't connect this to Persefoni — doesn't think *she's organizing her life around me the way Rosemary organized her life around George.* The parallel is for the reader, not for him. But it's there: two women whose orbits depended on a single gravitational center. George was Rosemary's center. Démion is becoming Persefoni's. The collapse, when it comes, follows the same physics.

8. **The season.** He doesn't miss games. Games are performance — public, three hours, the machine turning on because the machine knows how to turn on. He plays every game. But he misses practices. Practices are preparation — private, repetitive, the place where the body maintains itself. Skipping practices means the body isn't being maintained. The machine is running on old fuel.

   The degradation is slow but real. Not in the stats — the stats are still elite, still the best in the league, because the gap between Démion and everyone else is so large that a diminished Démion is still better than the best version of anyone else. But in his body, he knows. The arm that always threw the perfect spiral is slightly off — not visibly, not in ways the broadcast captures, but in ways his body registers. The 0.5-degree shift from the dropped pass has found company: another fracture, another thing the body is carrying that the mind won't process.

   Jim Harbaugh notices. Harbaugh excuses the practice absences — bereavement, family crisis, the organization making space for its franchise quarterback. Harbaugh is the kind of coach who knows when to push and when to let a man carry his weight in silence. But Harbaugh sees it. The backup gets extra reps. Ladd McConkey adjusts to throws that arrive a half-beat late — the young receiver building trust with a quarterback whose timing is a fraction off, learning the new rhythms without knowing why the old rhythms changed. McConkey doesn't know what it means. He adjusts.

   The Chargers miss the playoffs. Whether this is because of Démion's diminishment or factors outside his control — injuries, the conference, the math of a league built to produce parity — is unclear. The ambiguity matters. The reader can't assign blame cleanly. The machine was bent, but the machine might have lost anyway. The not-knowing is the point.

   Then the offseason arrives. And for the first time ever, the offseason isn't about recovery and preparation. It's about staying. The machine is idle. The body that was built for the game has no game, and the vigil continues, and the continuing is the hardest thing — harder than any game — because games end. This doesn't end. The crying doesn't end. The Pooh episodes repeat. The curtains stay drawn.

9. **La.** Démion interacts with La during the crisis. She's managing everything — the healthcare aftermath, Rosemary's discharge, the arrangements, George's estate, the logistics of death. Démion sees La the way he sees all systems: as something that functions or doesn't. La functions. La is impressive — the speed, the competence, the way she navigates bureaucracies that were designed to be unnavigable. He respects her the way he respects a good offensive coordinator: someone who makes the machine run so he can do his job.

   His job right now is Persefoni. La handles the world. He handles her. The division of labor is clean and it works and it's the first time Démion has operated as part of a team where his role isn't the star. He's the support. The rock. The body that holds. And the body is good at this — surprisingly good, naturally good, the way the body is good at everything it decides to do. He didn't know he could be this. He is this.

10. **The most sympathetic Démion will ever be.** This needs to be stated plainly: this is it. This is the peak of the reader's love for Démion. After this chapter, the emptiness begins (2.09), the wedding follows (2.10), and the wedding night ends him as a person the reader can root for. The reader needs to feel, in this chapter, the full weight of what Démion is capable of when the machine yields to the man. He is capable of tenderness. He is capable of putting someone else first. He is capable of being present — not the field's presence (grasping, demanding, performing) but something closer to the Master's presence (holding, carrying, staying).

    And the tragedy is: this is as close as he gets. This is the ceiling. The man who holds Persefoni through her father's death is the same man who will, two years later, do the thing he does on their wedding night. The tenderness is real. The rape is real. The same body does both. The reader needs to hold both truths simultaneously — and this chapter makes that possible by making the tenderness undeniable.

## The Core of This Chapter

The body's goodness.

Démion's body has always been the instrument of his greatness — the arm, the speed, the size, the instinct. The body on the field is transcendence. The body with Persefoni has always been chemistry — the pheromones, the wanting, the physical certainty.

Now the body discovers a third mode: care. The body that threw the perfect spiral in the Super Bowl is the same body that picks Persefoni up off the bathroom floor when she can't stop crying. The body that absorbed hits from 260-lb linebackers absorbs her grief — holds it, carries it, doesn't flinch from it. The body is good at this. The body has always been good at everything, and now everything includes holding a woman who is falling apart.

This is not redemption. This is not the chapter where Démion becomes a different person. He is exactly who he's always been — a man who lives in the body, who lets the body tell him what to do. The body told him to play football and he played football. The body told him to want Persefoni and he wanted her. The body is now telling him to hold her and he's holding her. Same instrument. Same instinct. The body doesn't distinguish between greatness and goodness — it just does what it does, and right now, what it does is keep her alive.

The tragedy isn't that this goodness is fake. It's that it's real. The goodness and the violence live in the same body. The man who holds her through grief is the man who pins her on her wedding night. The body that carries both is not contradictory — it's complete. Démion contains everything. The everything is what makes him devastating.

## Football Takes a Backseat — What This Means

This has never happened before. Not once. Not in high school, not in college, not in five seasons with the Bucs, not in the Super Bowl. Football has always been the first thing — the organizing principle, the drive that everything else wraps around. Persefoni was "football and her" — parallel, equal, the second of two. She has never been the only one.

Now she's the only one. And the being-the-only-one is Démion at his most human — the moment where the machine yields and the man emerges and the man is good. Simply, physically good. A good man holding a grieving woman and not letting go.

But the machine doesn't stay yielded. Six months is long enough to feel permanent and short enough to be temporary. The machine will come back. The next season will arrive. Training camp will call. The body will return to its first language — the game, the field, the confirmation. And when the machine comes back, the memory of yielding will be filed the way Démion files everything: acknowledged, not engaged with, put somewhere he won't have to look at it.

The yielding was six months. The machine is permanent. And the woman who experienced being-first — who felt, for half a year, what it was like to be more important than football — will carry that feeling forward. She'll remember it. She'll wait for it to come back. It won't come back. The machine doesn't yield twice.

---

## Démion and George — The Loss

George was audience. Démion grieves the loss of audience — and more.

This sounds cold but it isn't — or it is, but the coldness is structural, not personal. Démion genuinely liked George. The big man, the big voice, the phone calls after games, the "that's my boy" that felt like being claimed by a father who chose you. George confirmed him through warmth — the voice, the enthusiasm, the immediate total absorption of Démion into the family narrative. They needed a George and Démion needs one too — not consciously, not in any way he'd name, but the body knows. The body misses the man who said "that's my boy" and meant it.

Now the phone doesn't ring after games. The voice is gone. The bungalow in Gulfport has a porch with no one on it and a grill with no one at it and Démion walks through the house and the rooms are wrong — too much space, not enough life, the physics of absence.

He grieves this. He grieves it the way the body grieves: by noticing the missing. The missing phone call. The missing voice. The missing presence that was always there and now isn't. After every game, his thumb hovers over the phone. The body expecting the thing that isn't coming. The grief is shallow compared to Persefoni's — but the shallowness is honest. Démion doesn't pretend to feel more than he feels. He feels the absence. He carries the absence. He doesn't know what else to do with it.

## The Domestic Texture — How This Chapter Feels

This is where the chapter lives. The big dramatic beats (the Sunday game, the hospital arrival) are the frame. The six months of couch vigil is the painting.

**The house.** Persefoni's Santa Monica place. The two-bedroom near the bluffs. Windows everywhere — the Pacific visible from the living room. But the curtains are drawn. The famous California light doesn't enter. The house is lit by screens. The air is stale. Démion opens a window once and Persefoni asks him to close it. The wind — the motif — is not welcome here. The stillness is what they need. And the man built for motion learns to be still.

**The shows.** Winnie the Pooh. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. On repeat. On loop. The same episodes cycling through the same warm voices saying the same gentle things. The women on the couch, blankets over their legs, the television doing what Démion's body can't do — providing the specific frequency of kindness that George generated without trying. Pooh is the Master energy: simple, present, warm, arriving without being summoned. Mister Rogers says "you are special" and means it the way George meant "BABY GIRL." These are not entertainment. They are medication.

**The crying.** It comes from nowhere. It comes from everywhere. Persefoni will be sitting, seemingly fine, seemingly stable — and then the body changes. The sound starts in the chest before the mouth. The grief has no trigger. It arrives like weather. And Rosemary catches it — grief is contagious between these two, the mother and daughter yoked to the same absence — and then the couch is two women crying and one man holding and the bear on the screen is talking about blustery days. This happens on a Tuesday. It happens on a Thursday. It happens in the middle of the night. It happens for six months.

**The not-going-outside.** Weeks without the front door opening except for Démion leaving for games and returning. The Pacific fifty yards away and invisible. The mail accumulates. La handles the deliveries, the logistics, the world outside the door. Inside the door: Pooh. Mister Rogers. Crying. Sleep. The domestic loop of grief that has no arc, no narrative shape — just the repetition, the endurance, the body of a man built for stadiums sitting on a couch designed for someone smaller, holding.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Wind** | Still. The air doesn't move. The wind that was playoff energy and hurricane force is gone — the world after George's death is airless, the specific suffocation of grief. Inside the Santa Monica house: the air is stale, the windows don't open, the house is holding its breath. Démion opens a window once. Persefoni asks him to close it. The wind is not welcome. The stillness is what they need. A man built for motion in a world that has stopped moving. |
| **Stone** | Démion as rock. Literally: the rock she clings to, the immovable thing in the current. His body as stone — solid, present, the thing that doesn't crumble. But stone has a cost: the rock doesn't feel the water. Démion holds her and is solid and the solidity is both his gift and his limit. He can be the rock. He can't be the river. He can be the stone. He can't be the weather. George was weather. |
| **Red** | George's warmth, extinguished. The chapter opens with the memory of George's color — the Alabama crimson, the Gulfport sunsets, the warmth that filled every room — and the color is gone. What's left is the cold: hospital lighting, the specific blue-white of institutional spaces, then television light. Red returning only in Persefoni's face — the rawness of crying, the flushed skin of a woman who can't stop. Red as pain instead of warmth. |
| **Blue** | Hospitals. Screens. Television light — the blue flicker of Pooh and Mister Rogers in a darkened room. The institutional blue-white of the healthcare system that failed George. The Chargers' blue — Démion's new team color, the blue he wears now, the blue that replaces Tampa's red. The color shift is the symbol: from red warmth to blue efficiency. From the Master's color to the Emissary's. The whole house is blue light now. |
| **The Body** | The body as instrument of care. Démion holding Persefoni — the size of him, the weight, the physical fact that 250 lbs can absorb a grief that would knock a smaller man down. The body picking her up. The body putting food in front of her. The body on a couch it doesn't fit, holding two women while a cartoon bear talks about honey. The body's goodness — real, instinctive, the same physical intelligence that makes him the greatest athlete alive, deployed in service of the women he's trying to keep alive. And: the body's limit. He can hold them. He can't heal them. He can't be George. The body does what it can and what it can is not enough and the not-enough is what makes it beautiful. |

## Threads Planted

- **She was first.** For six months, Persefoni was more important than football. She'll remember this. She'll wait for it to happen again. It won't. The machine yields once. The yielding is the cruelest gift: it shows her what's possible and then takes it back.
- **The machine returns.** Football takes a backseat but the backseat is temporary. Next season will arrive. Training camp will call. The body will return to its first language. When the machine comes back, the man who held her through grief will become the man who needs her to fit inside his schedule again. The regression is not cruelty — it's architecture. The machine was always coming back. It was always going to be the first thing. The six months of being-first were the exception, not the rule.
- **Rosemary's collapse.** Démion sees a woman whose identity depended entirely on one man. He doesn't connect this to Persefoni. The reader does. The parallel is planted: a woman who orbits a man, the man dies or fails or rapes, and the woman's orbit collapses. Rosemary's collapse is Persefoni's future, inverted — Persefoni won't nearly die, but she'll walk into the desert, which is its own kind of cardiac event.
- **Harbaugh and McConkey.** The new football world, glimpsed. Harbaugh sees the shift in his quarterback. McConkey adjusts to the new rhythms. The Chargers are building something, and the something includes a quarterback who is carrying more weight than a quarterback should carry. This plants the LA football world for later chapters.
- **La as the handler.** Démion sees La handle the crisis and respects the competence. This plants their dynamic going forward — La as the person who manages the world so Démion and Persefoni can exist inside it. In Act 3, La will handle the post-wedding-night crisis with the same competence, and Démion will be on the other side of that handling.
- **The body's goodness and the body's violence.** The same arms. The same 250 lbs. The body that holds her through grief will pin her on the wedding night. This isn't foreshadowed in the chapter — the chapter is pure goodness, pure tenderness, the body at its best. The foreshadowing is structural: the reader carries the knowledge of what's coming and feels the tenderness as both beautiful and terrible. The same body. The same man. The goodness doesn't cancel the violence. The violence doesn't cancel the goodness. Both are real.
- **Démion in her space.** He moves into her house — the house she bought with her own money, her name, the one thread of independence she maintained. For six months it's their house. The independence she built is shared now. When the machine comes back, when he returns to his Bel Air house and the schedule resumes, the Santa Monica place will be hers again — but the memory of him in it, of his shoes by the door, of his body on her couch, will remain. Her space was shared. The sharing was the grief. The grief was the most intimate thing they ever did.

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)

- Something about football disappearing — not leaving, not being rejected, just becoming smaller. The first time the game wasn't the biggest thing in the room. She was the biggest thing in the room.
- "Football and her" — the phrase from 2.02, returning. But now it's "her and football." The order changed. He didn't change it. It changed.
- Something about holding her — the physical reality. 250 lbs holding 130 lbs. The mathematics of it. The body's ability to absorb another body's grief the way it absorbs a hit on the field.
- George's phone — the phone that doesn't ring after the game. The silence where the voice used to be. The thumb hovering. The body expecting.
- Something about trying to be George — grilling on her patio, fixing a cabinet, standing in the kitchen doing the things the big man did. But the rooms are warm and quiet. George's rooms were warm and loud.
- The bear on the screen — Pooh talking about honey while two women cry on a couch and a man holds them both. The specific frequency of children's television as grief medication.
- Mister Rogers saying something and the crying pausing — the women going still, the screen doing what his body can't do.
- Something about not letting her disappear — she wants to go under the blanket, under the world, under everything. He won't let her. Not through words. Through the body. He picks her up.
- Rosemary in the guest room — the mirror without the thing it mirrors. The face that doesn't know what expression to make without George's face to reflect.
- Something about being good at this — the surprise of it. The body discovering a new skill. He's good at holding someone. He didn't know he could be this.
- The window — opening it, being asked to close it. The wind not welcome. The stillness is what they need.
- Something about the offseason arriving and the game not calling him back and the vigil continuing and the continuing being harder than any game.

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not a redemption arc. Démion doesn't change. He discovers a capacity he didn't know he had, and the discovery is temporary. The machine comes back. The man who holds her through grief is the same man who does what he does on the wedding night. This chapter doesn't redeem him — it makes him complete.
- It's not about football. Football recedes from this chapter — that IS the chapter. The recession is the story. The first time Démion's life has a shape that isn't organized around the game. He still plays every game, but the games are interruptions now. The living happens on the couch.
- It's not sentimental. Démion's goodness is physical, not emotional. He doesn't cry. He doesn't make speeches. He holds her. He stays. He picks her up. The tenderness is in the doing, not the feeling.
- It's not about George. Démion grieves George honestly and shallowly — the absence of audience, the missing phone call, the trying-to-fill-his-shoes. The chapter isn't about his relationship with George. It's about his relationship with Persefoni when everything else falls away and what's left is the body holding another body.
- It's not dark. This is the lightest Démion chapter in the book — the most human, the most tender, the most lovable. The darkness is structural: the reader knows what's coming. The tenderness in this chapter is what makes the wedding night unforgivable.

## Resolved Questions

- **Démion arrives Sunday night.** He knew. La called him Saturday night — George was already dead. La called again Sunday morning — Rosemary was in the ER with a heart attack. He knew before the game. He played anyway — the Cowboys in Dallas, Sunday afternoon. He could have walked away. He didn't. He played, flew to Birmingham after the game, walks into St. Vincent's CICU late Sunday night. Not unreachable — reachable and chose the game. This is worse than "didn't know." This is the thing Persefoni carries: the man who knew her father was dead and her mother was in the ICU and played a football game. La was first. The trio was first. When Démion arrives, Persefoni has been holding the room all day — being George for her mother. His arrival is the moment the mode shifts from logistics to holding — from La's competence to his body's presence. But the arrival carries the weight of the choice. The fact that he chose the game is what makes his subsequent transformation — putting her completely first for six months — a surprise. The man who played football while her father's body cooled in Alabama and her mother's heart was failing in Birmingham is the same man who then holds her through grief with a tenderness that surprises everyone. The machine yielded — but not immediately. It yielded after one last game. One last confirmation that the game was first. And then it wasn't.
- **How long does football take a backseat?** Six months. November 2026 through ~May 2027. Long enough to span the rest of the NFL season (including playoffs) and into the offseason. Long enough to feel like a different life. Short enough that the machine comes back when training camp arrives.
- **He doesn't miss games.** He misses practices. Games are performance — the machine turns on for three hours because the machine knows how to turn on. Practices are preparation — private, the place where the body maintains itself. The degradation shows in the body, not the box score.
- **He moves into her house.** Not flying back and forth. Not commuting from Bel Air. He moves into Persefoni's Santa Monica two-bedroom with a bag and stays for six months. Her house. Her space. His body filling it.
- **Rosemary can't go home.** The Gulfport bungalow is George's house. Every room is him. She stays in Persefoni's guest room in Santa Monica.
- **Harbaugh doesn't speak.** No direct pressure from the football world. No confrontation, no conflict from the game side. Harbaugh is a presence felt through Démion's body — the awareness that the coach sees the crack — but he doesn't say anything. The football world gives Démion space. The absence of pressure from that direction makes the vigil feel more total: he's not being pulled between two demands. He's simply chosen one.
- **The healthcare failure from Démion's side:** He just sees the result. The death, the grieving women, the system that got it wrong. He doesn't engage with the injustice — he doesn't even know about the waiting room, the ten minutes, the delay. La handled the fight. He sees the aftermath. The body registers the outcome, not the process.
- **The Chargers don't make the playoffs.** It's unclear to the reader whether this is because of Démion's domestic situation or because of factors outside his control. The ambiguity matters: the reader can't assign blame cleanly. The machine was bent, but the machine might have lost anyway. The not-knowing is the point.
- **Démion's stoicism is total.** He doesn't cry. Not once. Not in the car, not in the bathroom, not alone. The body holds. The body has always held. The grief lives in the body the way the grief leaked through on the field — in the half-beat pause, in the thumb hovering over the phone — but it never breaks the surface. The rock doesn't crack. This is his gift and his limit: the same stoicism that makes him the perfect vigil-keeper is the same stoicism that will make the wedding night possible. The body that never breaks is the body that never fully feels.

## What This Chapter Does

1. George as original cult leader of personality — charming, drinking, ignoring family
2. Gaslighting chain: George → Rosemary → Persephoni
3. Tender-headed core memory triggered
4. McGilchrist introduced (adorable, boring)
5. First crack in Kathleen friendship — Kathleen chooses Alejandro over their shared play
6. Master/Emissary delivered through Alejandro's labored poetic translation
7. Persephoni connects it effortlessly — "why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it"

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene A — The day unfolds (~11 AM - 3:30 PM)
George at pub all day. Rosemary at picnic table. Alejandro at every talk. Girls goofing off. McGilchrist talk at 4.

### Scene B — The McGilchrist talk (4 PM)
McGilchrist adorable but boring. Persephoni tries to riff with Kathleen. Kathleen shuts her down. Nobody looking at Persephoni. She leaves alone.

### Scene C — The pub / gaslighting chain (~4:30 PM)
Overhears Rosemary wanting the castle. George charms her into staying. Rosemary surrenders. Persephoni approaches as ally. Rosemary repeats George's words. Tender-headed flash. "Okay." Walks out alone.

### Scene D — Alone / Alejandro's explanation (~5 PM)
Wanders. Stone wall. Alejandro finds her, buzzing. The effortful translation: king and servant. Persephoni sees it instantly. "Why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it." Match lit in a dark room. "Can we get food?"

## What This Chapter Does

1. Opens on the playoff run. The regular season is over and Démion has done what everyone said he'd do — led the Bucs to the playoffs as a rookie. The city is electric. The city expects to win again — Champa Bay, they're calling it, the Lightning and the Rays already champions, the Bucs fresh off Brady's Super Bowl, and now Démion is younger, faster, more impossible than what came before. Persefoni is inside the machine now — the WAG section, the box seats, the tunnel after games, the escalating intensity of a playoff run where every Sunday might be the last. She's never experienced anything like this. The stakes aren't hers and they consume her anyway.

2. George retires from Intel. This has been building — he's been at Intel in Beaverton for decades, the semiconductor technician who showed up every day and filled the break room the way he fills every room. Multiple reasons converge: he's at retirement age, Persefoni is in Florida, and the pull of the South — closer to Alabama, closer to his roots, closer to the daughter who is the center of his world. Rosemary doesn't need convincing. Rosemary has never needed convincing about anything George decides. They're moving to Florida.

3. **The trio forms.** This is the chapter where Persefoni finds herself inside a group of three again — and the group is its own thing, not a replacement, not a replica, but a shape she recognizes without naming. Kelli Garcia (the realtor who sold her the condo, now finding George and Rosemary a house) and Ashli Dotson (Mike Evans' wife, the only real friend she's made in the WAG world). Two women who don't know each other until Persefoni introduces them — and the introduction creates something immediate, something with its own chemistry. Three women who crack each other up. Three women who, together, are more than the sum of their parts.

   The dynamic: they are all hilarious. All three of them. All performers and all audience at once — the roles don't divide, they rotate. Kelli starts a bit and Persefoni escalates and Ashli delivers the line that kills them both. Ashli says something dry and devastating and Kelli riffs on it and Persefoni is the one doubled over. Persefoni does a voice and Ashli plays the straight man and Kelli breaks first. The comedy is democratic. Nobody leads. Nobody follows. The circuit doesn't have a direction — it flows everywhere at once, the way the best conversations do, three people who are each the funniest person in the room and none of them cares who gets the laugh because the laugh is the point.

   What made Kathleen special: she was both audience and performer. She watched Persefoni AND she played back. She was the whole circuit in one person. Now Persefoni has found two more people who are each the whole thing — two more women who can watch and play, see and create, be the one laughing and the one making the laugh in the same breath. Three complete circuits instead of one. The thing Kathleen was, times three.

   The echo of the original triangle is structural, not conscious. Persefoni doesn't think: *this feels like before.* She doesn't name it. But she feels something she can't name — a rightness, a completeness, the specific joy of being inside a group where everyone is both seen and seeing, where the comedy is collaborative and the collaboration is effortless and nobody has to carry it alone.

   She doesn't follow the feeling. Following it would mean looking back. She's not looking back.

4. **Kelli Garcia at Smith & Associates.** Persefoni's realtor — the woman who sold her the condo in St. Pete. Now Persefoni calls her for George and Rosemary. Kelli is good at her job and funny and treats Persefoni like a person who needs a house, not like a celebrity who needs handling. The phone calls about square footage and closing costs turn into twenty-minute riffs. Kelli sends listings. Persefoni responds with voice memos that are half house-hunting, half comedy. The comedy is the specific kind that comes from two women whose brains work at the same speed — not intellectual comedy, not improv, just the natural riffing of two people who find the same things funny and can't stop once they start.

   Kelli almost matches Persefoni's natural charm and charisma. This is rare — almost nobody does. But Kelli has the specific Florida-realtor warmth dialed to a frequency that's genuinely disarming, the kind of woman who makes you feel like the most interesting person in the room while also being the most interesting person in the room. She and Persefoni egg each other on — one raises the stakes, the other raises them higher, neither willing to be the one who breaks the bit. But Kelli is also the one who catches Persefoni off guard — drops a line so unexpected that Persefoni is the audience, Persefoni is the one losing it, and the losing-it is a relief because she's so rarely the one who gets surprised.

5. **Ashli Dotson.** Ashli Evans (née Dotson) — born in Texas, raised in Texas, psychology major at Blinn Junior College who wanted to be a counselor before she met a wide receiver through their roommates in 2013 and her life took a different shape. Married Mike in 2016 at The Corinthian in Houston — twenty-six bridesmaids and groomsmen, Jimmy Choo shoes, the whole production. By the time Persefoni enters the WAG world, Ashli has been doing this since 2014. She's been the NFL wife through the draft, the moves, the seasons, the away games, the injuries. She has Mackenzie (Mike's daughter from before, who Ashli calls her "bonus daughter" with zero hesitation), Ariah (five), and Amari (two). She divides her time between Texas and Florida and runs a lifestyle blog and co-founded the Mike Evans Family Foundation with her husband.

   The foundation focuses on children in need and families affected by domestic violence.

   Persefoni doesn't know yet why that detail will matter.

   What makes Ashli different from every other woman in the WAG section: she has her own center of gravity. The psychology background isn't incidental — Ashli sees people. Not magnitudes, not follower counts, not the particular species of fame that Persefoni radiates. Ashli sees a nineteen-year-old girl in a box suite who is the most famous person in the room and also the youngest and also, underneath all of it, someone who could use a friend who doesn't want anything from her.

   Ashli in the trio is not the quiet one. People assume — the psychology major, the mother of three, the NFL wife who's been doing this for seven years — that Ashli is the grounded, steady one. She is. She's also the one who says the thing so dry and so devastating that the other two can't breathe. Ashli's comedy is different from Persefoni's and Kelli's — it's slower, it arrives from a direction you didn't see, it lands with the deadpan precision of a woman who studied human behavior and finds it genuinely hilarious. She doesn't try to keep up with their speed. She doesn't need to. She waits, she watches, she drops the bomb. And then she watches them lose it, and the watching is half the comedy — Ashli watching Persefoni and Kelli fall apart is Ashli performing, because she knows the timing of her own silence, and the silence is the setup.

   The psychology background gives her attention a specific quality — she sees people, she reads rooms, she asks the question behind the question. But she doesn't analyze the comedy or the friendship. She just participates. Fully. As herself — funny, warm, grounded, a woman who knows who she is because she built it herself.

6. **The Wine House scene.** The trio crystallizes here. George and Rosemary meet Kelli to look at houses, and Persefoni brings Ashli. The Wine House in Gulfport — the pink-fronted wine bar and BBQ joint on Beach Boulevard, the kind of place where the motto is "Sauce is Life" and the wine list leans organic and the vibe is funky and unpretentious and exactly Gulfport. The owner, Paige, is a good friend of Kelli's — the place is classy and chic the way Taylor Swift is classy and chic — baring her soul. Instagrammable not because it's curated but because it's genuinely itself, the pink front, the flamingos, the kind of spot Persefoni's audience would devour.

   This is the first time all three women are together. And the chemistry is immediate — not manufactured, not gradual, not the careful building of a friendship over weeks. It's instant. Kelli says something to Persefoni about a listing. Persefoni riffs on it. And Ashli — who has never met Kelli before this lunch — says something so quietly lethal that both women stop and stare and then the table erupts. That's the moment. Not Kelli and Persefoni discovering each other — they already know they're funny together. It's both of them discovering that Ashli is *in it*. That she's not watching from outside. That the dry Texas deadpan is its own kind of performance, its own comedy, and the three of them together are something none of them is separately.

   George watches them and grins, recognizing the energy — two women operating at a speed he can't match but loves watching, and a third woman whose attention holds the whole thing together. Rosemary watches too, quieter, with the expression she always wears when Persefoni is being most herself — pride and something else, something she doesn't name.

   Kelli finds them the bungalow. It's perfect. George declares it perfect before he's seen the backyard.

7. **The Gulfport bungalow.** George and Rosemary buy a house in Gulfport — the little artsy beach town tucked against the south side of St. Pete. Not glamorous. Not a mansion. A cute bungalow, the kind of house where you can hear the Gulf from the porch and the neighbors wave and nobody cares who your daughter is dating. George loves it immediately. Of course he does — George loves everything immediately. Rosemary loves it because George loves it. The bungalow is fifteen minutes from Persefoni's condo. The family is together again, the way it was always going to be, because the Mintons orbit Persefoni the way everything orbits Persefoni — not because she demands it, but because she's the center of gravity and always has been.

8. The playoffs escalate. Each round bigger than the last. The WAG section gets louder, the stakes get higher, the machine runs faster. Persefoni is swept into it — the energy, the physicality, the tribal thing that happens when a city believes its team can win everything. She grew up watching Alabama with George. She knows what this feels like from the couch. But being IN it — being the quarterback's girlfriend, being in the box, being the person the camera finds — is different. It's the Cult of Personality at industrial scale: a narrative so big it swallows a city, and she's inside it, and the inside is intoxicating.

   The trio during the playoffs: Ashli is next to her at every home game. And after the Wine House — after the three of them found the thing they are together — Kelli is there too. Ashli and Persefoni wouldn't have it any other way. Kelli isn't a WAG, isn't part of the machinery, has no football reason to be in the box. She's there because the trio is the trio and two sides of a triangle is just a line. The three of them in the box: riffing on the commentary, on the crowd, on the specific absurdity of being behind glass watching men collide on grass while eating catered shrimp. Ashli doing a color-commentary voice that makes Kelli choke on her wine. Kelli narrating the WAG section like a nature documentary. Persefoni doing Sheepey's take on American football and all three of them gone, useless, the kind of laughing that makes other people in the box look over and want to be part of it. The trio working the way it works — everyone performing, everyone watching, the comedy flowing in every direction at once.

9. George during the playoffs. He's in Florida now. The bungalow in Gulfport. Fifteen minutes from her condo. He comes to every home playoff game — not in Cowboys gear this time. Or maybe still in Cowboys gear, because George is George and loyalty doesn't bend. But the cheering is total, unreserved, the big man in the box seat on his feet every play, the "THAT'S MY BOY" audible three sections over. George is the loudest person at every game he attends, and in the playoffs, his volume matches the stakes. He calls Démion after every win. The phone calls are longer now, breathless, the big voice filling the phone the way it fills rooms: "Son, you are SOMETHING. You are SOMETHING ELSE."

   Rosemary next to him. Sweet, trying, wearing a Bucs jersey that's too big for her because George bought matching ones. She doesn't fully understand football — she never has — but she understands George's joy, and George's joy is enough. She cheers when he cheers. She stands when he stands. The mirror.

10. The Super Bowl. The biggest game. Persefoni is there — in the box, in the suite, in whatever ecosystem the families inhabit at the Super Bowl. Ashli is next to her. Kelli is next to Ashli. George is somewhere nearby, the volume at maximum. The game is the game — Démion is transcendent, the best player on the field, doing things that make the announcers run out of words. He is everything he said he'd be. The machine at absolute peak.

11. The dropped pass. End of the game. Démion throws the pass that wins the Super Bowl. The pass is perfect — the spiral, the placement, the timing. Mike Evans has to catch it. Mike Evans always catches it. Mike Evans has been catching everything thrown at him for eight seasons. The ball hits his hands. And it doesn't stay.

    From Persefoni's POV: the moment fractures. The box. Ashli's face — and this is important, because Ashli's face changes differently than everyone else's. The other faces are shock, disappointment, the generic grief of fans watching a loss. Ashli's face is something else. Ashli's husband just dropped the pass. The psychology major who sees everything is seeing her husband's hands fail on the biggest stage in the world, and what crosses her face isn't disappointment — it's the specific pain of a woman who knows what this will mean, who has been an NFL wife long enough to know what a moment like this does to the men and the marriages and the dinners that come after.

    The sound — or the absence of sound, the stadium vacuum that happens when sixty thousand people inhale simultaneously. George's voice cutting through the silence, still believing, still narrating triumph even as the ball hits the turf. And then the game is over. And they lost.

    She watches Démion on the field. She's far away — in the box, looking down. She can't see his face. She can see his body. And something in how he stands there, not moving, not going to the handshake line, just standing — something in the stillness of a man who has never been still on a football field — tells her something changed. She doesn't know what. She can't name it from up here. But the body that always knew what to do is doing nothing, and the nothing is new.

12. The aftermath. She finds him. Wherever the families meet the players after a Super Bowl loss — the tunnel, the locker room perimeter, the hallway. He's showered. He's dressed. He looks the same. He IS the same, almost. The "almost" is the thing she can't locate. He holds her. He says something about next year. He's fine. He's Démion. The loss is a number — one game, one play, one drop. The machine will run again next season. He's already past it.

    Except he's not. And Persefoni — who reads people the way she reads rooms, instinctively, without analysis — feels the almost. The 0.5-degree shift in temperature. The thing that changed that he can't name and she can't name and neither of them will talk about because how do you talk about a temperature shift you can't prove?

    What she doesn't think about, but the reader might: Mike Evans is Ashli's husband. The dropped pass doesn't just live between Démion and Mike. It lives between the couples. It lives in the dinners that will still happen and the ease that will be almost-the-same. And it lives in the trio — because the trio includes Ashli, and Ashli's husband is the one whose hands didn't hold. The triangle that just formed, the three-sided thing that felt right, now has a crack running through one of its sides. Almost.

## The Core of This Chapter

The golden age at its peak — and the first crack.

Everything in this chapter is working. The machine is running. The playoffs are electric. George is in Florida. The family is together. The trio has formed — Ashli, Kelli, Persefoni, three women who together give her something she hasn't had since Beaverton. The power couple narrative has reached the Super Bowl. The confirmation machine has escalated to the biggest stage in American sports. And Persefoni is inside all of it, swept up, present, alive with the energy of a city and a family and a boyfriend who is proving to the world that there's never been anyone like him.

And then one dropped pass. One ball that doesn't stay in the hands it's supposed to stay in. And the machine stutters. Not breaks — stutters. A half-second of stillness where there should be motion. A 0.5-degree temperature shift.

The crack isn't dramatic. It's almost invisible. That's the point. The biggest cracks always are.

## The Trio — The Kathleen Echo

This is the thematic center of the chapter: Persefoni, without knowing it, has found the thing she lost — multiplied.

What made Kathleen special: she was both audience and performer. She watched Persefoni AND she played back. She was the straight man who was also funny — the one who said "the goat farmer had land" and made the comedy collaborative. Kathleen was the whole circuit in one person: seeing and creating, laughing and being laughed at, the witness who was also a participant. That's what made Sheepey work. That's what made their friendship electric. Not that Kathleen watched Persefoni perform — that Kathleen was in it with her, fully, as both audience and co-creator in the same breath.

Now Persefoni has found two more people who are each the whole thing.

**Ashli** is both. The dry deadpan that lands like a depth charge — she's performing. The way she watches Kelli and Persefoni lose it after she's delivered the line — she's audience. The psychology major who sees everything is also the woman whose timing is impeccable, whose comedy comes from a completely different direction than the other two and is funnier for the contrast. She doesn't just watch the circuit — she's in it.

**Kelli** is both. The riffs, the escalations, the rapid-fire energy that matches Persefoni's speed — she's performing. The way she breaks when Ashli says the quiet devastating thing, the way she watches Persefoni do a voice and her face says *where did that come from* — she's audience. The realtor whose professional warmth is genuine warmth is also a woman who can be caught off guard and whose being-caught-off-guard is generous, is the gift of someone letting you surprise them.

**Persefoni** is both, and this is the revelation. She's always been the performer — the center, the gravity, the one the room watches. But in the trio, she's also audience. She gets surprised. She gets wrecked by Ashli's timing. She loses it at Kelli's escalations. For the first time since Kathleen, she's not carrying the comedy alone. She's inside it. She's being made to laugh as often as she's making others laugh. And the being-made-to-laugh is the thing she didn't know she was missing — the relief of not being the funniest person in the room, or of being the funniest person in a room with two other funniest people, and the competition isn't a competition. It's play.

Three complete circuits instead of one. Three women who are each what Kathleen was — audience and performer simultaneously — and together they create something richer than any pair could hold. The comedy doesn't flow in one direction. It flows everywhere. Anyone can start it. Anyone can end it. The roles rotate so fast they stop being roles and become a single thing: three women who are genuinely, helplessly funny together.

The trio is NOT a replacement. It's not Persefoni finding new Kathleen(s). It's its own thing — its own chemistry, its own jokes, its own dynamic. Three women in their own right, with their own lives, meeting each other in the specific context of Florida and the NFL and Gulfport and the WAG section and finding something real. The echo of the original triangle is for the reader, not for Persefoni. She doesn't think about Kathleen when she's laughing with Ashli and Kelli. She just laughs. And the laughing fills something she didn't know was empty.

The difference from the original triangle: no romance, no entanglement, no betrayal. No sex to break it. No boy in the middle confusing the circuit. Three women, clean lines, genuine affection. The version where nobody gets hurt.

Until the dropped pass. Because the dropped pass doesn't just crack Démion — it cracks the trio. Ashli's husband dropped the ball. And the triangle that formed so easily now has weight it didn't ask for. Not broken. Just — weighted. The ease that was the whole point becomes the thing that's hardest to maintain. The dinners continue. The laughter continues. Almost.

## Ashli and Persefoni — What the Friendship Means (Beyond the Trio)

Ashli is the first real friend Persefoni has made since Kathleen. Not a brand relationship, not a professional contact, not a fellow WAG performing proximity — a friend. A woman who sees her and likes what she sees and doesn't need anything from the seeing.

The friendship forms the way real friendships form — not through a single revelatory moment but through accumulation. Ashli saves her a seat. Ashli texts her during away games. Ashli invites her to the house for dinner with the kids, and Persefoni sits on the floor with Ariah and Amari and does the Sheepey voice and the kids lose their minds and Ashli watches from the kitchen with the expression of a woman who sees exactly what's happening: a famous girl remembering how to play.

The domestic violence foundation matters. The Mike Evans Family Foundation works with families affected by domestic violence. Ashli is vice president. She has spent years thinking about what happens when the people who are supposed to love you hurt you instead. This is planted here and detonates in Act 3 — Ashli is the friend who will still be there after the wedding night, the friend who has a framework for what happened even when Persefoni doesn't. Ashli will know what it's called. Ashli will have always known what it's called.

The couples pair naturally. Mike Evans is Démion's guy on the field — the veteran receiver, the quiet professional, the man who catches everything thrown at him. Mike and Démion together are easy the way football is easy: the body's language, preparation and performance. Dinner with the four of them is the closest thing to normal life that Persefoni has in the NFL world. And it IS normal — Ashli cooking, Mike grilling, Démion and Mike talking film study, Persefoni helping Ariah with something, the kids running around, the domestic architecture of two couples who fit together because the fitting is genuine.

Démion likes that Persefoni has Ashli. He likes it because Mike is his guy. He likes it because it makes the power couple narrative richer — the franchise quarterback and the franchise receiver, their wives best friends, the whole picture so perfect it looks designed. He doesn't notice that Ashli is the only person in his world who sees Persefoni as something other than a magnitude. He doesn't notice because noticing would require him to see Persefoni as something other than a magnitude too.

## George in Florida

George in Gulfport is George at full bloom. The bungalow fits him the way everything fits George — immediately, totally, as if the house was waiting for him to fill it. He's on the porch. He's at the grill. He's walking to the waterfront and waving at neighbors and within a week everyone on the block knows his name and within a month he's the mayor of the street, the man who organizes the block party, the man whose laugh you can hear from three houses down.

Rosemary unpacks. Rosemary arranges. Rosemary makes the bungalow a home — the curtains, the kitchen, the guest room that's always ready for Persefoni. She does this with the quiet efficiency of a woman whose identity is built around making George's choices beautiful. He chose the house. She makes it livable. The pattern, the pattern, the pattern.

George retired because multiple things converged: he's the right age, Persefoni is here, and the South is calling him home. Beaverton was always temporary — an Intel town, a tech corridor, a place to work. Florida is warm and Southern and close to Alabama and fifteen minutes from his daughter and he can watch the Bucs in person now, every game, every Sunday, the big man in the box seat his daughter's boyfriend provides. The box seat is important to George — not because he's materialistic, but because it confirms his place in the story. His daughter is dating the number one pick. George is in the box. George is part of the narrative.

## Motifs in This Chapter

| Motif | How It Appears |
|-------|---------------|
| **Wind** | Playoff energy — the wind of a crowd, the roar that moves through a stadium like weather. The hurricane from 2.01 has become a metaphor: the NFL season is its own storm system, building, building, peaking at the Super Bowl. Wind that builds and then — stops. The dropped pass is the moment the wind dies. |
| **Stone** | George settling. The bungalow as stone — the permanent thing, the house, the roots finally planted. George as stone in the warm sense: solid, grounding, the foundation of the family. Also: Démion's stillness after the loss. The monument that doesn't move when it should be moving. Stone frozen, which is new. |
| **Red** | George's warmth. The Gulfport sunsets. Alabama crimson, still underneath everything George is. The warmth of the trio — three women together, the red of genuine connection, the Master's color in a world dominated by the Emissary's machine. Red still safe, still warm. |
| **Blue** | The screens. The broadcast. The Super Bowl watched by a hundred million people — the ultimate copy machine, two people on a field becoming images on a hundred million screens. Blue as the medium of the machine. Also: the blue of the Gulf, visible from George's porch, the water that connects this family's geography. |
| **The Body** | Démion's body on the field — transcendent, impossible, the thing the whole world is watching. And then: his body standing still. The contrast between the body in motion (everything Démion is) and the body at rest (something new, something wrong). Persefoni reads his body from the box the way she reads all bodies — instinctively, without analysis. The body tells her something changed. |
| **Threes** | The trio. Three women. The echo of three people in a car, three people at a festival, three people in a yurt. Persefoni inside a triangle again — but this one has different geometry. No tension. No romance. Just the completeness of a shape she knows. |

---

## Threads Planted

- **The trio and the Kathleen echo.** Three women who are each the whole thing — audience and performer simultaneously, the way Kathleen was. The reader sees what Persefoni doesn't: she's found the thing she lost, multiplied. Not Kathleen split into halves, but Kathleen's wholeness found in two more people. Three complete circuits. This plants the trio as a real thing — a friendship triangle with its own weight — that the dropped pass immediately complicates and that Persefoni will carry forward.
- **Ashli and the foundation.** The Mike Evans Family Foundation works with families affected by domestic violence. Ashli has been thinking about this — professionally, philanthropically, personally — for years. When the wedding night happens, Ashli won't need it explained. Ashli will know the word for it. This friendship is a lifeline being laid down before the drowning.
- **The dropped pass.** Mike Evans drops the ball that wins the Super Bowl. This lives between the two couples forever. The dinners continue. The friendship continues. But the dropped pass is in the room. And the trio carries it too — Ashli's side of the triangle now weighted with something the other two sides can feel but won't name. Démion doesn't blame Mike — or says he doesn't — but the crack is there. The first time the machine failed, and the failure wasn't his. For a man who considers himself peerless, someone else's failure is more destabilizing than his own would be, because he can't fix it, can't improve it, can't train it away.
- **George in Florida.** The family is together. The bungalow in Gulfport, fifteen minutes from the condo. George at full volume, filling the neighborhood the way he fills everything. The reader should feel the warmth and the permanence and — if they're reading the structure — the dread. George is so alive in this chapter. George fills so much space. The filling hides everything.
- **Kelli Garcia.** Introduced as more than a realtor — a genuine relationship, the co-performer, the woman who keeps up. This plants Kelli as part of the network of real people (Ashli, Kelli, Lauria) who see Persefoni rather than the Personality. Kelli knows the Florida real estate world, knows the St. Pete community, knows Persefoni outside the fame.
- **Persefoni reading Démion's body.** After the loss, she feels the temperature shift. She can't name it. She reads people instinctively — this is the Master's attention, gathering without grasping. She gathers information about Démion that he doesn't know he's broadcasting. This plants her capacity to read the room on the wedding night — and her inability to stop what her body tells her is happening.
- **The almost.** The word that defines the aftermath. Démion is almost the same. The dinners with Mike and Ashli will be almost the same. The trio is almost untouched. The machine is almost intact. "Almost" is the crack's vocabulary — not broken, just shifted. The reader should carry "almost" forward.

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)

- Something about the playoffs from inside the box — the glass between her and the field, the proximity that's also distance, watching the man she loves from a remove that feels like metaphor
- The Wine House scene — the first time all three women are together, the instant chemistry, Kelli and Persefoni riffing while Ashli laughs with the laughter that means she sees
- A Kelli Garcia phone call — the riff, the escalation, the comedy of house-hunting with a woman who eggs her on
- George declaring the bungalow perfect before seeing the backyard — the man who says yes to everything, who fills every space before he's measured it
- Something about Ashli watching — the specific quality of her attention, the gathering, the way her seeing completes the circuit
- Ashli with the kids — Persefoni doing the Sheepey voice on the floor, Ariah and Amari losing their minds, Ashli watching from the kitchen
- The trio at a playoff game in the box — Kelli and Persefoni cracking each other up over the catered shrimp, Ashli laughing, the three of them inside the machine but also, somehow, outside it
- The dropped pass — the silence, the vacuum, the sixty thousand people inhaling at once
- Ashli's face in the moment of the drop — different from everyone else's face, the face of a wife, not a fan
- George's voice cutting through: still believing, still narrating, the volume refusing to accept what just happened
- Démion standing still on the field — the body that always moves, not moving. Something changed.
- "Almost." He's almost the same. She can almost believe it.

---

## What This Chapter Is NOT

- It's not dark. The golden age is still golden. The playoffs are thrilling, George is in Florida, the trio has formed. The dropped pass is a crack, not a collapse. The reader should feel the warmth and the joy and the machine running and only at the very end feel the 0.5-degree shift.
- It's not about football. The playoffs matter as energy, as escalation, as the machine building toward its peak. But the chapter is about Persefoni's world filling up — the trio, the parents, the life that feels complete. The Super Bowl is the climax but the substance is the relationships.
- It's not a Kathleen chapter. The echo is for the reader. Persefoni doesn't think about Kathleen when she's with Ashli and Kelli. She doesn't compare. She doesn't narrate the parallel. She just feels something right and lives in it. The reader does the rest.
- It's not critical of anyone. George is wonderful. Ashli is wonderful. Kelli is wonderful. Démion is transcendent. The chapter earns the reader's investment in all of these people so the losses hit harder later.
- It's not planting the villain. The dropped pass plants something in Démion, but the chapter doesn't dwell on it from her side. She feels it. She can't name it. She moves on. The naming happens in 2.06.

## Open Questions — Resolved

- **Where is the Super Bowl?** SoFi Stadium, LA. A nice prelude — the first time Persefoni sees the city she'll move to. LA as geography, planted before it becomes home.
- **Does George still wear Cowboys gear?** No. George wears a Bucs jersey. The Cowboys aren't in the Super Bowl this year. George's loyalty bends for his son-in-law when there's no conflict to maintain. He's all in.
- **How much of the playoff games do we see?** Through the lens of the trio in the box. The games are texture — the escalation, the energy — but the camera stays on the three women watching, riffing, laughing. The football is what's happening on the other side of the glass. The trio is what's happening on this side.
- **When do Kelli and Ashli first meet?** The Wine House. That's the origin. The specific place, the specific lunch, the chemistry igniting in a scene the reader can see.
- **Kelli at the Super Bowl?** Resolved: she's there. Two sides of a triangle is just a line.

## What This Chapter Does

1. First time inside Sergey's head — the reader has seen him from outside in 1.1, now we're in
2. Establishes his natural internal voice: technical, precise, taxonomic, classifying
3. Shows the EFFORT of his poetry — reaching for images, laboring to translate frameworks into beauty
4. Establishes why the festival matters to him — McGilchrist, the divided brain, what he hopes to hear
5. Shows how he sees Persephone — cataloging her, drawn to her effortless seeing, the guilt of it
6. The car scene: everyone around him, Sheepey bits still going, and he's somewhere else entirely
7. George and Rosemary from Sergey's perspective — the family he wishes he had

## Sergey's Internal Voice

**Native mode:** Technical. Definitions. Frameworks. He thinks in words like:
- "Phenomenological" — and he means it precisely, not as decoration
- "Ontological" — the study of what exists, what's real
- "Dialectic" — the tension between two opposing ideas that produces a third
- He categorizes instinctively. People, experiences, ideas — everything gets filed.
- His mind works like an index. Cross-referenced. Precise.

**The effortful poetry:**
- He WANTS to speak beautifully. He studies poetry. He's in a band. He writes songs.
- But the images don't come naturally. They're constructed. Labored over.
- There's always a visible seam between what he thinks and what he says.
- When he finds a good one, he holds onto it. Turns it over. Is pleased.
- When he can't find it, he falls back on the jargon and hates himself a little.
- Sometimes in the car he'll be working on a translation — trying to turn a concept into an image — and nobody knows he's doing it. They think he's just quiet.

**His music:**
- The one place the effort disappears. When he plays guitar or writes a song, the images come without the translation step.
- He doesn't fully understand why this is. (The reader might: music is the Master's language.)
- He probably has a guitar with him on this trip. Or wishes he did.

**How he sees Persephone (from inside):**
- He doesn't think "she's beautiful" in a simple way. He thinks something more like: she processes the world through a faculty he can identify philosophically but cannot replicate experientially.
- Then he catches himself thinking like that and tries to translate: she just SEES things.
- He's been watching her all day at Stonehenge. The way she noticed the sheep. The way she said "like a church made out of sound."
- That line is still echoing in him. He's turning it over. He couldn't have said it. He would have said something about "the acoustic intentionality of Neolithic architecture" and it would have been accurate and dead.
- She made it alive in six words. Without trying. Without knowing what she did.
- This is what draws him. Not just that she's beautiful — though she is, and he notices, and the guilt of noticing sits in his stomach like a stone because Kathleen is RIGHT THERE.
- It's that she's native to a territory he's immigrating to.

**How he sees Kathleen:**
- He loves Kathleen. Or he thinks he does. Or he loves the version of love he's built with her.
- She's kind. She shows up. She holds his hand. She asks about his interests.
- But she doesn't GET them. And he knows the difference.
- When he explains something to Kathleen, she smiles and nods. When he explains something to Persephone, she says something that makes him stop walking.
- He feels guilty about this distinction. He files the guilt somewhere precise.

**How he sees George:**
- The dad he never had. George asks him questions and listens. George treats him like he matters.
- Sergey's own parents are academics. They love him in the abstract. They forget to ask how his day was.
- George asks and then stays for the answer. Sergey would do almost anything for George.
- But he also sees George clearly — the drinking, the performing, the way Rosemary dims when George shines. He catalogs this too. He doesn't know what to do with it.

## Scene Breakdown

### The car
- George driving. Rosemary passenger seat. Three kids in back — Sergey behind George, Kathleen middle, Persephone behind Rosemary.
- Sheepey bits are still happening. The girls haven't stopped. George is trying to do the accent from the front seat. Rosemary is trying. It's terrible.
- Sergey is in the backseat and he's somewhere else.

### Sergey's anticipation
- He's been reading about McGilchrist for months. Maybe a year.
- He found *The Master and His Emissary* at a used bookstore — or online — and it reorganized his brain.
- He's 15. He shouldn't be reading this. But his parents are academics; he grew up around books that were too old for him.
- The book gave him a framework for something he'd been feeling but couldn't articulate: that there are two ways of seeing the world, and one of them has swallowed the other.
- He wants to hear McGilchrist speak the way other kids want to see their favorite band.
- This whole trip — England, Stonehenge, all of it — he made this happen. He asked George. George said yes. (George always says yes to things that make other people happy.)

### Persephone from Sergey's POV
- She's doing Sheepey's voice. Full British accent. Kathleen is dying laughing. George is trying to join in.
- Sergey watches her and thinks something precise — something about how she constructs characters with an immediacy that suggests right-hemisphere dominance in narrative processing.
- Then he catches himself and tries: she makes things real just by saying them.
- Better. Not great. He keeps working.
- She catches him looking. "What?" He shakes his head. "Nothing."
- It's not nothing.

### The festival explained (to himself, not out loud)
- How The Light Gets In — he knows the Leonard Cohen line. "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."
- He probably has thoughts about why that's the perfect name for a philosophy festival.
- He's thinking about what McGilchrist will say. Running through the arguments in his head.
- Maybe he's rehearsing his own explanation — trying to find the right image for the Master and the Emissary. Working on the king-and-servant metaphor in advance. Testing it. Revising.
- The poetry doesn't come easy. He's been working on this translation for a while.

### Arrival at Hay-on-Wye
- They pull into the town. Bookshops everywhere. Tents. Music.
- Sergey sees it and feels something he can classify precisely (anticipatory cognitive arousal in response to an environment optimized for intellectual engagement) and also something he can't classify at all, which is just: home. This feels like home.
- He doesn't say this out loud. He says: "This is going to be amazing."
- Persephone says: "You said that about Stonehenge."
- He did. She's right. But this time he means it differently and he doesn't know how to explain the difference.

## Key Lines (TBD — to be found in drafting)
- Something about the effort of translation
- His internal technical thought followed by the attempt to make it human
- "Nothing." (When Persephone catches him looking.)

## Threads Planted
- Sergey's interior established — the reader now knows how he thinks vs. how he speaks
- His attraction to Persephone named from inside — not just beauty but her effortless seeing
- His guilt about Kathleen — present, filed, unresolved
- His relationship with George — the surrogate father
- He sees George's patterns clearly but doesn't know what to do with what he sees
- McGilchrist anticipation — sets up 1.3 (the talk, the pub, Sergey's explanation)
- The king-and-servant metaphor — he's been WORKING on it. It didn't just come to him.

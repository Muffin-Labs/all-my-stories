She knew before he asked.

Not because of the ring — she didn't see the ring until his hand came out of his jacket pocket, and by then the knowing had been in her body for thirty seconds, maybe longer, maybe since the moment she opened the door and saw his face doing the thing his face did before a big play. The stillness. The alignment. The way every part of him organized around a single intention and the intention was so obvious that the only surprise was the formality.

He'd driven across the bridge. She could see it on him — the drive, the sunset, the decision already made, the certainty that had been his whole personality since the first night but was now pointed at something bigger than sex and the pointing was unmistakable. He was standing in her doorway and his eyes were doing the thing where they held hers without blinking and the holding was not a request, it was a fact, and the fact was that Démion Reyes was about to propose to her one week after his first NFL game and four months after their first date and she was eighteen years old and she knew the answer.

The answer was yes.

The answer was absolutely, completely, with-her-whole-body yes, and the yes arrived before he spoke, before the knee, before the ring — the yes was in her chest the way his scent was in her chest, below thought, in the place where the body just knew. She wanted to marry this man. She wanted to marry him the way she'd wanted him since October, since the couch, since the elephant shirt, since something turned over in her sternum watching a boy throw a football on her dad's TV and she didn't know yet that the turning-over was the beginning of her life rearranging itself.

Yes.

But.

He came inside. She let him in the way she always let him in — the door, the hallway, the condo that was hers, the space she'd bought with her own money at eighteen because she'd learned, the hard way, that living in someone else's space meant living inside someone else's story. He walked through her living room and the room adjusted to him the way rooms did — the furniture scaling down, the ceiling lowering, everything becoming smaller and more intimate because he was in it and he was 6'6" and the world was always renegotiating its dimensions around him.

They sat on the balcony. The bay was flat and dark below them, the lights of Tampa on the other side — his side, the city that was learning to worship him, the stadium where a week ago he'd played the best game anyone had ever seen. The last red edge of sunset was fading behind the Gandy Bridge, the sky going from copper to bruise, and a warm wind came off the water and moved through her curls without catching. The air was thick, September in St. Pete, the humidity that never left, the particular weight of Florida air that she'd stopped noticing until moments like this when she noticed everything.

He reached into his jacket pocket.

"Wait," she said.

He stopped. His hand was in the pocket. The shape of whatever was in there was visible through the fabric — small, square, unmistakable. She could see the ring box pressing against the linen from the inside, the geometry of it, the obvious thing in the obvious pocket, and she almost laughed because Démion didn't hide anything, not ever, not the wanting, not the ring, not the fact that the jacket had a purpose and the purpose was a box and the box was a question.

"Before you do that," she said. "I need to say something."

He waited. His hand stayed in the pocket. The patience that was his whole self — the same patience that had waited six weeks, that had heard *not tonight* every night for two months and said *okay* and meant it and put it down — was on his face, steady, untroubled. He could wait. She'd seen it a hundred times — the way waiting never cost him anything, the way the space between knowing and having never seemed to change the outcome for him.

"Yes," she said.

His face changed. The stillness cracked into something bright and the bright thing was the smile, the touchdown smile, the one the camera found, the *I knew this would happen* —

"But not yet."

---

The smile didn't fall. That was the thing about him — the smile didn't fall. It adjusted. It went from the full wattage of a man hearing what he already knew to the slightly dimmer, slightly curious version, the one she'd learned to read over four months: *I'm listening but I already know where this is going and where it's going is okay.*

"Not yet," he said.

"Not yet."

"Okay." He still hadn't taken his hand out of his pocket. The ring was still in there, still pressing against the linen, still a question that had been answered and not-answered in the same breath. "When?"

She'd been thinking about this. Not in the way she usually thought — not intuitively, not in the body, not in the place where decisions arrived fully formed and she just recognized them. She'd been thinking about this in the other way. The careful way. The way a boy in Oregon had taught her to think, without meaning to, without knowing she'd absorbed it — the way you think when the stakes are permanent and your equipment is temporary.

"You know what the prefrontal cortex is?" she said.

He looked at her. She could read the look — the face of a man who knew what a Cover 2 was, who knew what his body could do in a collapsing pocket with two men trying to drag him to the ground, and who had no idea what a prefrontal cortex was or what it had to do with marriage.

"It's the front part of your brain," she said. She tapped her forehead. "Right here. It's the part that does — okay, like. Imagine your brain is a house."

"A house."

"A house. And every room in the house does a different thing. One room is memory. One room is, like, language. One room is the room that makes you feel things — love, anger, the thing you feel when you see me." She said this without blushing, without performing, with the casual certainty of a woman who knew exactly what she did to him and was not being coy about it. "All those rooms are finished. They've been finished since you were, like, twelve. The walls are up. The drywall is done. The paint is dry. You can live in those rooms."

"Okay."

"But there's one room — the front room, the big one, the one at the front of the house where you make the decisions that are supposed to last your whole life — and that room doesn't have a ceiling yet."

She watched his face. He was listening. She could see it in the way his whole body oriented toward her — the full weight of his attention, which looked nothing like the analytical kind, not the kind that classified and categorized and built frameworks. It was the attention of a man who looked at what was in front of him and seemed to see it completely and move on. He seemed to be seeing her completely right now.

"The prefrontal cortex," she said. "It's not done cooking until you're around twenty-five, twenty-six. It's the last part of the brain to finish developing. It handles judgment. Long-term thinking. The ability to weigh consequences — not just *do I want this* but *will I still want this in twenty years* and *what am I not seeing right now that I'll see when I'm older.* That room. The room where you decide who to marry."

She paused. The bay was dark. The lights of Tampa were steady across the water.

"I'm eighteen," she said. "My ceiling isn't up yet."

---

He didn't say anything for a moment. The moment was the length of a breath, maybe two, and in the silence she could hear the bay — not the water itself but the aliveness of it, the boats, the distance, the bridge somewhere in the dark connecting his city to hers.

"So how old?" he said.

"Twenty-six."

The number landed between them like something thrown. Not heavy — precise. A dart, not a stone. She'd thought about this. She'd done the math — not the math, the *knowing,* the understanding that had arrived in her body the way all her best understandings arrived, already processed, already certain. Her brain would be finished at twenty-six. Her birthday was in November. November 2028. Seven years from now.

"Seven years," he said.

"Seven years."

He looked at her. She looked at him. The bay was between Tampa and St. Pete and they were on the St. Pete side, on her balcony, in her space, the three-million-dollar condo she'd bought cash at eighteen because she'd already learned that the decisions you make about space determine the space you have to make decisions. She was in her space. She was making her decision.

"You know what you sound like?" he said.

"What."

"You sound like a girl who's turning down the number one draft pick because of a brain part."

She laughed. The laugh surprised her — sudden, loud, the sound escaping before she could shape it, bouncing off the balcony railing and out over the bay. He just said the obvious thing. He always just said the obvious thing, and the obvious thing was funny because it was true.

"I'm not turning you down," she said.

"No?"

"I'm saying yes. I'm saying yes with my whole body. I'm saying yes with every room in my house that has a ceiling." She leaned toward him. "I'm just not saying yes with the room that doesn't have one yet. Because that's the room where the forever decisions live. And I'm not making a forever decision with a room that's still under construction."

He was quiet again. Looking at her. She watched his face for the crack — for the flicker of doubt or disappointment or the tightening around the eyes that would mean she'd hurt him. Nothing. Just the patience. The calm. The same quality she'd loved since the first night — what looked like the certainty of a man who had never been told no and didn't panic when he was told *wait.* She read it as patience. Wait was not no. Wait was soon. Wait was the space between the snap and the throw, and Démion seemed to live in that space the way he lived everywhere — loose, unhurried, his body still angled toward her as if nothing had changed.

"So twenty-six," he said.

"Twenty-six."

"I ask again at twenty-six."

"You ask again at twenty-six."

He took his hand out of his pocket. The ring box came with it — small, black, the velvet catching the warm light from her living room through the glass doors, the fabric going almost red where the lamplight hit it. He didn't open it. He held it in his palm, turning it once, this small dense thing that had been a question and was now a promise — stone waiting for solid ground — and then he looked at her.

"I'm keeping this," he said.

"You better."

He put the box back in his pocket. And then he stood up and crossed the balcony in two steps and his hands were on her waist, his palms hot through the thin cotton of her shirt, and he was lifting her — again, always, the 130 pounds that was nothing to him — and she was in his arms with the wind off the bay pressing warm against her back and the seven years were in front of them and she kissed him and his mouth tasted like the coffee he'd drunk on the drive over and his stubble scraped her chin and the kissing was the yes, the whole yes, the yes with every room including the one without a ceiling, and the only thing holding back the forever was a part of her brain she'd learned about from a boy she didn't name in a car she didn't think about on a road she'd never drive again.

---

Later.

They were in bed. His arm was across her waist, heavy, the weight of it pinning her pleasantly to the mattress the way a warm blanket pins you — not trapping, just anchoring. His breathing was slowing into sleep. He fell asleep the way he seemed to do everything: immediately, completely. She'd never once seen him lie awake — no restless shifting, no staring at the ceiling, none of the *did I lock the door, did I say the wrong thing, is this really happening* that kept other people turning. His breathing just slowed and then he was gone, carried into sleep by whatever it was that carried him through everything.

She lay in the dark and thought about rooms.

The house metaphor. She'd made it up on the spot — or she thought she had, though the bones of it were older, the understanding underneath the metaphor coming from a place she didn't visit anymore. A boy in Oregon. A car on a winding road. A conversation about hemispheres and attention and the architecture of the brain that she'd half-listened to and fully absorbed, the way she absorbed everything — not through study, not through effort, but through the particular porousness that was her gift and her curse. She let things in. She let them all in. And the things she let in became hers, became her voice, became the way she understood the world, and the origins disappeared the way origins do when something has been fully metabolized.

She didn't think about the boy. She didn't think about the car or the road or the conversation or the blue glow of the studio where he'd sat up late building frameworks for things she understood without frameworks — the cool blue of the screen on his face, the blue that was always his color. She didn't miss him. She didn't feel guilty about not missing him. He was a source she'd absorbed and the absorption was complete and the knowledge was hers now — the brain develops on a timeline, the prefrontal cortex matures last, the decisions you make at eighteen are made with equipment that isn't finished yet — and she was using it to protect something he'd never imagined she'd have.

The boy had explained the brain. She was using the explanation to choose when to marry a man the boy would never meet, in a city the boy would never visit, in a life the boy was no longer part of.

Something borrowed, still working. She didn't have a word for what it was — a gift, a debt, an inheritance. She just knew the metaphor was right, and the metaphor was hers now, and the metaphor said: wait.

---

She thought about the gap.

The gap between the body's yes and the mind's not-yet. The space she'd learned to hold — not easily, not naturally, but with the hard-won discipline of a girl who had learned in two separate rooms what happened when the gap collapsed.

The yurt. The body frozen. The mind screaming. The gap closed by force — not her force, not anyone's force exactly, but the force of a thing happening in the dark that she didn't choose and couldn't stop and the closing of the gap was a violation she didn't have a word for because nobody had touched her.

The studio. The body open. The mind behind. The gap closed by overwhelm — the being-seen so total that her body said yes before her mind could say *wait,* and the morning after she walked home through smoke and the smoke was the color of what she'd done and the gap between her body and her mind had been the space where Kathleen lived and Kathleen was gone.

She'd learned to hold the gap. Two months of wanting Démion and not having him. Two months of his body next to hers in bed, the heat of him, the scent of him, and every night holding the space between *want* and *choose* until the two words arrived at the same moment in the same room and the word was *yes* and she meant it all the way down.

She was doing it again. The same discipline. The same gap. Except now the gap was seven years and the decision wasn't sex, it was forever, and the room where forever lived didn't have a ceiling and she was smart enough not to stand in an unfinished room and make promises about the weather.

His arm was heavy on her waist. His breathing was slow. The boy who had never been told no was sleeping beside a girl who had just told him *wait seven years,* and the sleeping was the proof of something — either that he trusted her timeline or that he'd already decided the timeline didn't matter. She couldn't tell which. She didn't try.

She closed her eyes. The bay was dark outside, and through the cracked window she could hear the water and feel the faintest wind crossing her ankles where the sheet didn't reach. The ceiling was above her — white, solid, the ceiling of a building she'd chosen on the twenty-third floor of a city she'd chosen in a life she was building one decision at a time, each decision made with the best equipment she had, knowing the equipment wasn't finished yet, choosing anyway to trust the process of becoming.

Twenty-six. Seven years. The number was a room she was building — stone by stone, year by year — and she would not move in until the walls were up and the ceiling was done and the roof kept out the rain.

She'd wait. She was good at waiting now.

---

The ring lived in his nightstand.

She never saw it again after that night on the balcony — he put it away and didn't mention it and the not-mentioning was the most Démion thing he could have done. He never checked in: *are you still thinking about it, have you changed your mind, what if we moved the timeline up.* He never angled for a revision the way she suspected Alejandro would have — the careful intellectual architecture of *but consider this, what if we reframed, have you thought about the counterargument.* Démion put the ring in the drawer and went back to football.

The season was in full swing. The Bucs were winning. He was becoming what everyone said he'd become — not a good quarterback, not a great quarterback, but the kind of quarterback that made people invent new categories because the existing ones couldn't hold him. She watched every game. She was there for every home game — the box, the suite, the specific geography of being the girlfriend of the most important man in the building. And she was good at it. She was good at it the way she was good at everything that involved being watched: naturally, easily, without the visible effort that would have made the watching feel like work.

The WAG section. The tunnel after games where she'd lean against the concrete wall and feel the stadium still vibrating through the soles of her shoes. The postgame dinners, the team events, the particular social machinery of the NFL that ran on wives and girlfriends the way the games ran on quarterbacks. She moved through it the way she'd moved through Tampa International four months ago — present, here, her skin awake, her eyes open, the other wives turning toward her mid-sentence the way people always turned toward her, the rooms rearranging around her presence the way rooms always had.

She was eighteen years old and she was building a life that looked, from the outside, like everything.

And when she came home from those games — the suite still buzzing in her ears, the stadium lights still printing on her retinas — she'd stand on her balcony and the bay wind would move through her curls and she'd feel the same thing she felt in the morning and at noon and in the dark next to him: that the inside matched. She loved him. She loved the condo. She loved La's competence, the brand growing, Sheepey scaling toward something larger than Instagram. She loved the heat and the open air and the bay between her city and his. She loved the seven-year promise sitting in a drawer, waiting for the ceiling to go up.

She was eighteen and her brain wasn't finished and she knew it and she'd acted on it — had looked the number one draft pick in the face and said *not yet* — and the knowing and the acting together felt like the strongest thing she'd ever done.

The ceiling would come. The room would finish. The promise would be kept.

She just had to wait.

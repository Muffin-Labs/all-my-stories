The last thing she did without thinking about it was dance.

Not the last-last thing — she would do other things without thinking, she would always do things without thinking, that was her whole deal, Kathleen said, that she moved through the world like it owed her a dance and she was there to collect. But the last thing she did without thinking about it *and then the world changed* was dance in her bedroom on a Tuesday night in December to a song she'd already forgotten the name of, wearing shorts and an old T-shirt of her dad's with a faded Intel Bunny People print on it — the dancing cleanroom workers in their bright jumpsuits, a relic from some company event her dad had kept because he kept everything, while Kathleen sat cross-legged on the bed holding her phone.

Five months since England.

Five months is a long time when you're sixteen and nothing when you're not, and Persephone was sixteen — had turned sixteen in November, a birthday party in the backyard with her dad grilling in the rain because he grilled in all weather conditions as a point of personal honor — and the five months since England had been both. Long because school had started and junior year was a machine that ate your days and gave you nothing back. Nothing because the three of them had settled into something that looked, from the outside, exactly like before.

It wasn't before. But it looked like it.

---

The patch had held.

The thing she'd built at Chepstow — the princess story, the hand-holding through the ruins, the comedy about Normans and boiled cats — had done what she'd meant it to do. It had drawn a line. Not a spoken line, not a rule anyone agreed to, but a line you could see in the way Kathleen and Sergey moved around her now. They were together. More together than before, actually — the yurt had given their relationship a new weight that Persephone could read in Kathleen's body, in the way she leaned into Sergey at the lunch table, the way her hand found his arm without looking, the way she touched him constantly with what looked like a new confidence. Kathleen moved around Sergey like a woman who owned something. It looked like possession. It looked like certainty.

But never in the ways that mattered most.

They never kissed on the mouth in front of her. Not once, in five months. They never held each other the way couples held each other — the kind of holding that said *this person is mine and I want you to watch me have them.* Kathleen's hand on his arm, yes. Kathleen's head on his shoulder, yes. But the line was there, drawn in invisible ink by a princess on a staircase, and they both held to it with what looked like the careful precision of people who'd been told — through a story about a village girl and a poet — exactly where the line was.

Persephone noticed the line. She noticed that they'd drawn it for her. Something in her chest loosened and tightened at the same time — loosened because they'd heard her, tightened because the hearing required a line at all. The three of them used to exist in a space where no lines were necessary. Where Sheepey could get drunk at Stonehenge and nobody needed rules about what you could and couldn't do in front of each other because the question had never come up. Now there was a line, and the line was shaped exactly like what happened in the yurt, and every time they didn't kiss in front of her she could see the outline of the thing they weren't doing, which was almost worse than if they'd just done it.

She didn't say any of this. She did Sheepey bits. She was, to all appearances, fine.

Sergey's music was getting better.

She heard it the way she heard everything about him — involuntarily, completely, the way you hear weather. He was always writing. He'd been writing before England and he wrote through England and he wrote after England, but the songs from after were different. The metaphors were less controlled. Something was leaking through the craftsmanship. The songs from before the trip had been clever, intricate, structurally impressive — the kind of music where you could see the boy who built it, the careful architect, every element placed with the precision of someone who didn't trust his feelings to arrive on their own and so constructed elaborate rooms for them to arrive in. The songs from after were messier. Rawer. A door left open somewhere.

She and Kathleen were still the band's biggest fans. They still thought & Amateur Cartography was the best music they'd ever heard. This hadn't changed. They went to every show — the small ones, the living-room ones, the kind of audience that fit in someone's garage and spilled onto the driveway when it got too hot. Sergey still didn't believe them when they told him he was brilliant. He still looked at them when they said it with that expression — the one that said *the sample size is too small and the subjects are biased and I appreciate the data but cannot accept the conclusion.*

But Persephone heard the new songs and she knew where they came from. The yurt. The two lights. The princess on the staircase. And she said nothing about this because what would she say? *Your pain made your art better* is not a thing you say to someone whose pain you caused and received simultaneously.

School was school.

They were juniors. The social dynamics of Beaverton High existed around them but didn't define them — the triangle had always been self-contained, three kids who were more interesting to each other than anyone else. Persephone was popular in the way that beautiful people were popular without trying: people wanted to be near her, wanted to talk to her, wanted her attention. Boys looked at her in the hallway and she registered this the way she registered the bell schedule — it was information, it happened, it didn't mean anything. Girls wanted to sit with her at lunch and she let them and was warm to them and forgot their names by the weekend. She wasn't cruel about it. She just didn't register most people the way she registered Kathleen and Sergey. They were the frequency she was tuned to. Everyone else was static.

It was a Tuesday night in early December. She was in her bedroom. Kathleen was on the bed. A song was playing — something from TikTok, one of those songs that's everywhere for two weeks and then gone forever, a trending sound that she'd heard in someone's story and Shazam'd and liked enough to play again. The room was warm with the fairy lights she'd strung along the wall above her bed — small, red-gold, the cheap ones from Target that gave everything a glow like a room in a painting. Clothes on the floor. Books she'd never finished on the nightstand. Kathleen's bag by the door. The room of a sixteen-year-old girl who was exactly where she was supposed to be.

She danced.

Not because of a plan. Not because she was thinking about who would see it. She danced because the song was playing and her body did what her body always did when music played — it found the thing and rode it. She'd always danced like this. In her room, in the kitchen while her dad cooked, in the back of the car when the radio found something worth moving to. She danced the way she talked: without plan, without self-consciousness, with the same instinct for rhythm and timing that she brought to a Sheepey bit. Her body did what her mouth did — it arrived at the thing and stayed there, and the thing was always right, or right enough that the difference between right and perfect didn't matter.

She'd never had a lesson. She didn't need one.

"Hold on," Kathleen said, and she was already reaching for Persephone's phone on the nightstand, already opening the camera, already holding it up with those big brown eyes focused on the screen the way they focused on everything Kathleen decided to care about — completely, without reservation. "Do it again."

Persephone did it again. Kathleen filmed it. They watched it back together on the bed — Persephone's face small and bright on the screen, the fairy lights behind her turning the whole frame gold, and something about the way she looked in that light, in that room, doing that thing — something the camera could see that she couldn't — made Kathleen's eyes go wide.

"Post it," Kathleen said.

Persephone posted it. She didn't think about it again. They fell asleep watching something on her laptop, the way they always did — Kathleen's head on her shoulder, the laptop balanced between them, the screen going dark while neither of them noticed.

The video got a hundred thousand views overnight.

---

She woke up to her phone doing something it had never done.

It was buzzing. Not the buzz of a text or an alarm — a continuous, arrhythmic vibration, like something alive and panicking, notifications arriving so fast they overlapped. She picked it up and the screen was a wall of numbers and names she didn't recognize. Comments. Follows. Shares. The notification badges had exceeded what the display could show — just a red circle with a number in it that kept changing, climbing, refreshing every time she looked at it.

"Kathleen." She shook the shoulder next to her. "Kathleen, wake up."

Kathleen made a sound like a door creaking and pulled the comforter over her face. Persephone pulled it back. She held the phone in front of Kathleen's closed eyes and waited. One eye opened. Then the other.

"What the fuck?" Kathleen said.

She sat up. She took the phone in both hands, the way you hold something fragile, and her mouth opened and didn't close. They sat there together in the grey morning light — Persephone's bed, Persephone's room, the fairy lights still on from last night, the comforter tangled between them — and watched the number climb. A hundred thousand. A hundred and fifty. The phone kept buzzing in Kathleen's hands and they kept watching and it was funny — it was hilarious, actually — the absurdity of a number that big attached to something she'd done in her pajamas while half-listening to a song she couldn't remember the name of. It was the kind of thing that happened to other people. People on the internet. Not someone whose morning breath you could smell.

"You have to do another one," Kathleen said.

Not because of strategy. Because it was fun and the first one had worked and Kathleen was the kind of friend who said *do it again* with the same excitement the second time as the first. So that night Persephone did another one. A different song, a different dance, the same bedroom, the same fairy lights, Kathleen holding the phone. This one got five hundred thousand views.

What happened to Persephone in December 2019 was the thing that happened to girls on the internet. Not all girls. Not most girls. A specific kind of girl — the kind the algorithm found and decided was the one, for reasons the algorithm could measure and no human being could name. She wasn't the best dancer on the platform. She was good. She was natural. People couldn't stop watching her. But there were better technical dancers, girls who'd trained for years, who could do things with their bodies that Persephone couldn't and wouldn't try. That wasn't what the algorithm was measuring.

The camera loved her.

The same thing her dad had. The same thing that made people lean in when he told a story at a bar, that made bartenders forget their other customers, that made her mom organize her entire life around being in the beam of his attention. Persephone had it on camera — a quality of presence, of *being here,* that the screen couldn't flatten. When she danced, you watched. You didn't know why you were watching. You watched the way you watched a fire or a river — not because it was doing something specific but because it was alive and you couldn't look away.

The pale green eyes. That was part of it — the comments said so, over and over, the same observation arriving from a hundred thousand strangers: *why do I feel like she's looking at ME?* The eyes, the smile, the way she moved with an ease that looked like the opposite of performance even though it was, by definition, being performed. She looked at the camera the way she looked at a person. The screen should have flattened this. It didn't. Whatever she had went through the glass.

By the end of the first week she had half a million followers. The content was pure dance. Trending sounds, popular choreography, lip syncs — the standard playbook, the thing every sixteen-year-old on TikTok was doing, except when she did it the numbers had extra zeros. She didn't practice the dances. She watched them once and did them. Her body picked up choreography the way her mind picked up stories — fast, whole, without needing to break it into pieces first. She learned a dance the way she built a Sheepey bit: by feeling the shape of it and stepping inside.

Kathleen held the phone. Every video. Every take. Kathleen was in the bedroom, behind the camera, framing Persephone with those big doe eyes focused and steady, and after every take she'd watch the playback and say things like "Do it again but slower at the end" or "The light's better if you stand by the window" or just "Yes. That one." Kathleen's eye. Kathleen's instinct. Every video that went viral passed through Kathleen's hands first.

She was the audience of one before the audience of millions. The invisible girl holding the thing that made the visible girl visible.

Sergey's reaction was Sergey.

He seemed interested — of course he seemed interested, his attention always tracked her the way a compass tracked north — but the interest had that quality. That taxonomic quality. He sat with them at lunch — the three of them at their usual table by the window, winter light coming in blue and thin through the glass — while Persephone showed him the numbers on her phone and she could see him classifying the phenomenon in real time. The way his eyes moved across the screen — not excited, not jealous, just *processing.* She could practically hear the gears turning. What it meant. What it said about the platform. About attention. About virality as a function of some variable he was trying to isolate.

"It's the parasocial eye contact," he said, after watching three of her videos in a row. "The way you look at the camera. People feel addressed. It triggers the same neural pathway as actual eye contact — the brain can't distinguish between a face on a screen looking at you and an actual person looking at you, if the gaze angle is right. Your gaze angle is perfect."

Persephone looked at Kathleen. Kathleen looked at Persephone.

"Thank you, Sergey," Persephone said, in the voice she used when Sergey was being Sergey. "That's the most romantic thing anyone has ever said about my face."

He turned pink. His mouth opened and something that wasn't quite a word came out and then he stopped and regrouped and said, "I just meant —" and Kathleen put her hand on his arm and said "We know, babe," and Persephone felt the old warmth — the three of them, the rhythm, the ease of being together in a way that still worked, that still had this. The Sheepey frequency. The thing the line hadn't killed.

He didn't seem to see the opportunity yet. If there was a creative opening — a place where her platform and his music could feed each other — he hadn't found it, or hadn't said so. Right now he was just watching. Classifying. Doing the thing Sergey always did when something was too new to name: taking it apart to see what it was made of.

---

Then she danced to "Careless."

Every other video was set to a trending sound — a song with millions of plays, a song everyone already knew, a song that was part of the machine. This one was different. Sergey had released "Careless" to Spotify the day before. Nobody had heard it. & Amateur Cartography had maybe forty monthly listeners — Persephone, Kathleen, a handful of kids from shows, Sergey's parents. The song existed in the world the way a letter exists before you open it: present, unread, waiting.

She heard it and knew.

Not slowly, not in pieces. She heard the title — *Careless* — and the knowledge arrived whole, the way knowledge arrived for her, the way it had arrived in Sergey's room when the cat lost her name and on the staircase when the princess opened her mouth. Her word. The word she'd thrown at him on a staircase in a ruined castle. *That's not brave. That's just careless.* He had caught it and turned it into this.

The song opened with a pulse — a single, low, repeating beat that she felt in her sternum before her brain identified it as music. Then his voice, spare and close, like someone talking in a dark room: *There isn't much that I need to keep / A steady hand and a map to read.* The layers built. Each cycle added something — a synth wash, a looped vocal, a bass tone that vibrated in her ribs — the whole thing accumulating the way weather accumulated, pressure building without a visible source. *With the lights drawn low and the walls worn thin / I only wanted to let you in.*

The yurt. The canvas walls. The two lights. He'd taken their story and put it in a song and she could hear every room in it — the yurt where the walls were thin, the castle where the walls were thick but not thick enough, the space between two beds where something broke that none of them knew how to fix.

*I didn't mean to be careless / Or to draw with a shaking hand.* The bridge, and his voice cracked on *careless* — not dramatically, not performatively, just the smallest fracture, the voice encountering the word and not being able to hold it steady. The shaking hand. His notebooks. The crossed-out lines, the arrows connecting ideas that didn't quite connect, the amateur cartography of a boy who could map everything except the thing that mattered.

And then the mantra. *To understand. To understand. To understand.* Eight times, building, each repetition adding a layer until the phrase stopped being words and became rhythm, became pulse, became the sound of someone asking for something they knew they couldn't have. The permanent plea of a boy who believed that if he could just explain it right, the feeling would follow. Except in the song the plea became the music. The asking became the thing itself. The reaching became beautiful because it would never arrive.

The chorus hit like weather. *I don't mean to seem like I knew what was there / Like I'd measured the dark / I just wanted the room with the two of you near / I was careless.*

The room with the two of you near. The yurt. The three of them. Before.

*I was careless.* Her word, returned. Not as a defense. Not as an excuse. An elegy. He was saying: *You were right. I know what we had and I know what I did to it and the word you used was the right word.*

She sat on her bed and she listened to it three times and then she stood up and she danced to it.

The dancing was her answer. She didn't plan it that way — she didn't plan anything that way, that was the whole point, she moved and the movement said the thing her mouth couldn't hold.

Kathleen wasn't there.

It was the first time. Every other video — every trending dance, every lip sync, every thirty-second clip the algorithm had swallowed and multiplied — Kathleen had been in the room. Kathleen's hands on the phone. Kathleen's eye framing the shot. But Persephone had bought a tripod that week — a cheap one, telescoping, from Amazon — because the volume of videos was becoming a thing and Kathleen had school and a life and couldn't always be there, and the tripod was practical, that was all, it was just practical.

She set the phone on the tripod. She pressed record. She danced to "Careless" alone in her bedroom with the fairy lights turning everything red-gold and the phone watching her with its flat, steady, unblinking eye — not Kathleen's eye, not the eye that knew her, just a lens on a stick — and the dance was different from the trending-sound dances. Slower. More felt. Her body finding the pulse — that primal, physical beat that lived underneath Sergey's cerebral lyrics — and moving inside it, and the moving said: *I hear you. I hear you back.*

She didn't show Kathleen first. She stood in the bedroom, still breathing hard, and her eyes caught the spot on the bed where Kathleen usually sat — the indent still visible in the comforter from last time. She posted it straight from her phone. It wasn't a decision. It was just what happened — the video was done and she posted it and it wasn't until later, lying in bed, that she realized it was the first video Kathleen hadn't seen before the world did.

Kathleen watched it on her own phone. She texted: *ok that one made me cry. you dancing to his song 😭😭😭* And then, a minute later: *also the light is different without me holding it. the tripod doesn't move with you. you should let me film the next one.*

She'd seen it. Not the content — not the yurt, not the answer — but the craft. The eye behind the camera noticing the camera had lost its eye.

And there it was. The gap. Six feet wide. The same gap as Virtue the Cat, the same distance between what Kathleen heard and what Persephone heard, except this time the gap was shaped like the three of them.

The next day at school — their usual table, the winter light blue through the glass — Kathleen was still talking about it. "It's gorgeous," she said, and she said it the way she said everything about his music — with what sounded like total sincerity, with what looked like uncomplicated love. And Persephone watched her face and saw nothing — no flicker, no recognition, no shadow of a yurt or a castle or a word thrown on a staircase. Just Kathleen hearing a beautiful song and saying so.

Persephone was almost certain — certain the way she was certain about Virtue the Cat, certain the way she was certain about six-foot gaps — that Kathleen had heard a beautiful sad song by the boy she loved and nothing more. Had heard *careless* as a word in a song. Had heard *the room with the two of you near* as poetry, as the kind of line Sergey wrote because Sergey wrote lines like that. Had heard something beautiful and been right — it was beautiful.

Persephone had heard their entire history compressed into three minutes and forty seconds. The gap between them, six feet wide, and Kathleen on the other side of it, smiling.

It was the only non-trending sound she'd ever used.

The comments exploded: *what song is this?? / anyone know this song / NEED this song immediately / ok but this might be the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.* People flooded to Spotify. Sergey's monthly listeners jumped from dozens to tens of thousands in a week. The mutual amplification started here — in a bedroom in Beaverton, with a girl dancing to a song about what the three of them lost, and only two of them knowing what it meant.

---

The climb was vertical.

Week one bled into week two and the numbers stopped being numbers and became weather — something happening around her, to her, that she couldn't control or predict or understand. A million followers. The word *followers* was wrong — it implied a choice, a decision to walk behind someone, when what was actually happening was more like a wave. She hadn't asked for the wave. She was standing on the beach and the ocean decided.

She and Kathleen watched it together. Every milestone. Kathleen would text her at three in the morning — *CHECK YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW* — and Persephone would open TikTok and the number would have jumped by another hundred thousand while she slept. A hundred thousand people. She couldn't picture a hundred thousand people. She could picture Kathleen's face on the other end of the text, bright with excitement, and that was one person, and a hundred thousand was a number that existed in the same category as the distance to the sun: you heard it and you nodded and you didn't understand it at all.

Two million. The number ticked over on a Saturday afternoon. They were on Persephone's bed, cross-legged, the phone between them like an artifact they were studying, and when it happened — when the number rolled from 1,999,xxx to 2,000,xxx — Kathleen grabbed her and they jumped up and stood on the bed and bounced and screamed and for a minute it was just two girls being excited and nothing else. No algorithm. No platform. No parasocial eye contact. Just Kathleen's arms around her and the mattress springs complaining and the sound of two people who loved each other celebrating something they didn't understand.

That was the best moment. She knew it even then — not in words, not as a thought she could have articulated, but in the way her body knew things: this was the purest version. The two of them on the bed, jumping, screaming, before anyone else arrived.

Her dad's whole body changed when he talked about it. He seemed to swell — his chest wider, his voice louder, his face lit up the way it lit up when he told a story at a pub and the whole room leaned in. He looked like a man watching his own reflection do something extraordinary. His daughter was doing the thing he'd always done: walking into a room and becoming the center of it. Except her room was the internet and the internet was bigger than any pub in any festival in any country. Her dad watched her follower count the way he watched football — leaning forward, narrating the experience to anyone within earshot.

"That's my baby girl," he said, at dinner, to her mom, to the table, to the kitchen. He said it the way he said everything — with his whole chest, with the warmth that made you believe him, that made you want to be part of whatever he was part of. "She gets it from me." He laughed when he said it, the big laugh, the one that vibrated in your ribs, and he wasn't wrong — the magnetism was inherited, the presence was genetic, the camera loved her the way rooms loved him — but the claiming of it, the *she gets it from me,* was her dad doing what he always did. Narrating someone else's reality as a chapter in his own story.

He'd show his coworkers at Intel. He'd pull out his phone at holiday gatherings and play her videos for aunts and uncles and neighbors, holding the screen up like a man showing you a photo of a fish he'd caught. "Four million views on this one. My kid. My Persephone." And the aunts would gasp and the uncles would shake their heads and her dad would beam, and nowhere in his narration was the bedroom or the fairy lights or the girl on the bed holding the phone. Kathleen didn't exist in her dad's version of the story. His version had a star and the star had his genes and that was the whole plot.

Her mom said "That's wonderful, baby" in a voice that sounded like something was wonderful and also something else — a voice with a crease in it, a fold, like a letter that had been opened and refolded so many times the paper was going soft at the seam. "Just be careful what you put online." The second one got ignored the way it always got ignored — not rudely, not consciously, just the way you ignore a sound you've heard so many times it's become part of the background. Her face did the thing it did after the worry got ignored — the small tightening around her mouth, the blink that lasted a beat too long, and then the smoothing, the recovery, the face returning to its normal position like a door that had opened a crack and been gently closed. Persephone saw it and filed it the way she filed everything about her mother — in the growing collection of things she noticed and didn't know what to do with.

---

Christmas.

Her dad's sister flew in from Alabama with her husband and three kids, and the house in Beaverton was full the way her dad liked it — too many people, too much food, the volume at a level where you had to lean in to hear the person next to you, which was her dad's preferred communication distance. He'd been cooking since dawn. The kitchen smelled like brown sugar and butter and something smoked and her mom was doing the thing she did at holidays — moving through the house like a hummingbird, refilling glasses and straightening napkins and making sure everyone had what they needed before anyone knew they needed it.

Persephone had more followers than her school had students. More than her town had people. The number was a fact and the fact didn't feel like anything yet. It was too big. It was the distance to the sun — you heard it and you nodded and you went on living in the world directly in front of you, the world that was her dad in a Santa hat and her cousins fighting over the Xbox and Kathleen arriving at the door with a present she'd wrapped badly on purpose because Kathleen thought bad wrapping was funnier than good wrapping.

Her dad held court. He sat in the living room in the big chair — the one that had been his since they'd moved to Beaverton, the chair that was shaped like him from years of use — and he told the story of Persephone's fame the way he told every story. With drama. With pauses. With the specific quality he had of making you feel like you were hearing something extraordinary even if you'd already heard it twice.

"My baby girl," he said to his sister. "Five million people. Five million. You know how many that is?"

"That's a lot, George."

"That's the whole city of Atlanta watching my daughter dance. Atlanta. The whole damn city."

He made it his. He did it with love — that was the thing about him, it was always love, the warmth was always real, the pride was always genuine — but the making-it-his was real too. He'd been doing it Persephone's whole life. When she was little and made something at school, her dad would hold it up and say "Look what my kid made" and the emphasis was always on *my.* My kid. My genes. My gift, passed down. The story of Persephone's talent was, in her dad's telling, a story about him.

Persephone sat on the couch and watched him tell it and felt the complicated thing she always felt watching her dad narrate her life — a warmth and a thinness, the feeling of being loved very loudly by someone who was also, without meaning to, making the story about himself. She loved her father. She loved him with the uncomplicated totality that daughters love fathers who are present and warm and fill rooms with laughter. But she could feel it — the thing she'd felt at the pub tent in Hay-on-Wye, the thing she'd felt watching her mom say "the views were something else" about a castle she'd never entered. Her dad was building the version. And the version was always his.

January. The numbers kept climbing.

She posted every day, sometimes twice. Not because of strategy — she didn't have a strategy, she was a sixteen-year-old in her bedroom — but because she liked it. She liked the dancing. She liked the feeling of a song finding her body and her body finding the shape of it, the way a sentence found her mouth when she was doing Sheepey. She liked Kathleen behind the camera, Kathleen's voice saying "That one" or "Again" or "Oh my God, yes." She liked the delight of it. She liked that it was fun.

The brand deals started in January. Emails to an address she'd set up as a joke — persephone.the.real.deal.minton@gmail.com, created to sign up for TikTok, never intended for anything. Companies wanting to send her things. Clothing brands. Makeup brands. A protein bar company. A teeth-whitening kit. She didn't understand what was happening. She'd open the emails and show them to Kathleen and they'd read them together on the bed and laugh at the language — *We'd love to partner with you on an exciting opportunity* — because the language sounded like it belonged to a world neither of them lived in. A grown-up world. A world where teenagers were *partners* and *opportunities* and not just girls in bedrooms with fairy lights and bad Wi-Fi.

She said no to all of them. Not on principle — she didn't have a principle about it yet. She said no because she didn't understand what they were asking for, and things you don't understand are things you don't do, which was a rule she'd never articulated but had followed her entire life, and it had served her well.

---

The thing about fame — the thing nobody tells you, because the people who could tell you are inside it and can't see the edges — is that it arrives as a series of descriptions.

You're not famous and then you are, but the *are* isn't a feeling. It's a collection of things other people say about you. An article calls you "the next Charli D'Amelio." A comment says you're "America's sweetheart." A tweet calls you "the most beautiful girl on TikTok." The descriptions arrive fast and they arrive from strangers and each one is a small story about who you are, and none of them are written by you.

Persephone read them. In bed at night, her phone glowing in the dark, Kathleen asleep beside her — actually asleep this time, genuinely asleep, the real breathing not the performed breathing — she scrolled through comments and articles and threads and she read the story the world was writing about her. The story was simple. A girl. Beautiful. Natural. Dances like she was born to it. Smile that makes you feel like she sees you. That was the character. That was the Persephone the internet had written — all smile and dance and beauty and nothing else. No Sheepey. No castle princesses. No cat who lost her name. No girl who lay still in the dark to protect someone she loved. Just the girl in the fairy lights, dancing, looking at the camera like she was looking at *you.*

She read these descriptions and she didn't recognize herself. Or she recognized a version of herself — a flattened version, a version pressed under glass, the way a flower pressed in a book still looks like a flower but isn't one anymore. The girl in the comments had Persephone's face and Persephone's body and none of Persephone's insides.

She didn't have the vocabulary for what was happening. She had the feeling — the way you have a splinter before you have a word for splinter, the way you have a bruise before anyone tells you it's a bruise. Something was forming around her. A story told by strangers, a version of her built from thirty-second clips, and the version was getting louder and the person inside it was getting quieter and she couldn't name this, couldn't hold it up to the light and say *that, that thing, that's what's wrong* — because the thing didn't have a name yet. It was just a feeling. An off-ness. A crookedness she couldn't locate.

She was sixteen. She was in her bedroom. She was reading comments on her phone and the blue light of the screen fell across her face and the fairy lights above the bed were red-gold and warm and she was caught between them — the cool glow of the phone, the warm glow of the room, the air perfectly still, the window closed against the December cold, no wind finding its way through these walls — and something felt wrong, not painful, not dangerous, just *off,* like a picture hanging crooked, like a note slightly out of tune. She put the phone down and turned over and pressed her face into the pillow and waited for it to pass.

It passed.

There was a moment.

Not dramatic. Not a trauma. Just a moment, the way a crack in a wall starts as a hairline you only see in certain light.

She was in the kitchen. Saturday morning. Her dad was making pancakes — his specialty, the ones with the banana slices pressed into the batter so they caramelized on the griddle, the smell filling the whole house. Her mom was at the table with coffee and her phone, scrolling with the absent focus of someone not really looking at anything.

"Persephone, come look at this," her mom said, and she held up her phone. An article. Someone had written about her — a website she'd never heard of, one of those content farms that produced articles about trending topics the way factories produced boxes: mechanically, identically, without care. The article was titled something like "Meet Persephone Minton: TikTok's Newest Dance Sensation" and it had three of her videos embedded and a paragraph of text that described a person she had never met.

*Persephone Minton, 16, from Beaverton, Oregon, has taken TikTok by storm with her effortless dance videos and girl-next-door charm. With her signature smile and natural talent, she's quickly become one of the platform's most-followed creators...*

Girl-next-door charm.

She read it standing in the kitchen with the smell of her dad's pancakes and the sound of his humming — he was always humming, always filling the space with himself — and the description sat in her stomach like something she'd eaten too fast. Girl-next-door charm. She was five-eight and biracial with pale green eyes and the kind of face that made grown men look away from their wives. She had never in her life been the girl next door. She had been the girl who walked into a room and the room rearranged itself. She had been the girl who held still in the dark to protect her best friend. She had been the girl who told a story about a princess on a staircase and made two people cry without raising her voice. *Girl-next-door charm* was what you said about someone whose actual qualities you hadn't bothered to observe.

It was wrong. Not malicious. Just wrong. The way her mother had been wrong when Persephone was small and had sat between her mother's knees getting her hair braided and the comb caught and Persephone flinched and she said, *Oh, that doesn't hurt. You're just tender-headed.* Not cruel. Not intentional. Just someone telling you what you're feeling, with a certainty that has nothing to do with what you're actually feeling, and the telling is so gentle and so sure that for a moment you almost believe them.

She put the phone down. "Cool," she said, and took a pancake off her dad's plate, and he said "Hey!" in his outraged voice and chased her around the kitchen island and she laughed, and the moment passed, and it was nothing.

But she noticed. The way she noticed things — involuntarily, completely, filed in the place where she kept things she knew but hadn't named yet. Someone was telling her who she was. The story didn't match. And she didn't know what to do about that except keep dancing.

February. The numbers were still climbing. The article was followed by more articles. The descriptions multiplied. Each one was a little different and all of them were the same — a girl, a face, a dance, a sensation. The descriptions built on each other, each new one citing the last, until the Persephone who existed in the descriptions was more real than the Persephone who existed in the bedroom. The description-Persephone had a signature smile. The description-Persephone had girl-next-door charm. The description-Persephone was natural and effortless and relatable, three words that meant nothing and meant everything, three words that were themselves a story about a girl who didn't exist.

The real Persephone — the one who heard a song about a cat and couldn't speak, who lay still in a yurt to protect Kathleen, who told a story about a princess because the truth was too true to say straight — that girl was still in the bedroom. Still dancing. Still doing Sheepey in the car. Still watching the numbers climb and not understanding what they meant and not understanding that the not-understanding was itself a kind of protection, the last wall between her and the thing the numbers were building around her.

She was inside it before she could see it.

Another Tuesday. Another song. Another video.

The bedroom was the same. The fairy lights were the same — red-gold, warm, the cheap lights from Target that made everything look like a room in a dream. The phone was on the nightstand, charging, waiting. Kathleen was on the bed with her legs crossed and her back against the wall and she was holding Persephone's other phone — the old one, the backup — because the main one had died from notifications.

"Ready?" Kathleen said.

And Persephone looked at her — her best friend, her person, the girl with the round face and the doe eyes who had sat next to her at lunch in second grade and never left — and she felt something move through her that was too big for the room. Love. The kind that didn't need a word because the word was too small. Kathleen was here. Kathleen was always here. Kathleen held the phone and framed the shot and said "That one" and never once asked to be in the frame. She was the invisible architecture of everything Persephone was building. The person who saw her before the world did. The person who held every video before every million people watched it.

Kathleen didn't appear in the videos. She wasn't asked to and she didn't offer. She was behind the camera the way she was behind everything — present, essential, unseen.

"Ready," Persephone said.

The song played. She danced. Her body found the thing and rode it and the fairy lights turned her skin gold and the camera — held by Kathleen's steady hands, framed by Kathleen's steady eye — caught whatever it was the world couldn't stop watching.

She was very good at this. And the bedroom — the room with the fairy lights and the unmade bed and Kathleen's bag by the door — was becoming something else. It was still hers. It still smelled like her shampoo and her laundry and the Target candle she'd burned down to a nub. But the camera had been in it now, night after night, and millions of people had seen its walls, and the room that used to be the last place that was just hers was becoming the first place that belonged to everyone.

The video ended. Kathleen lowered the phone.

"Perfect," she said.

Behind the camera. Behind the phone. Behind the fairy lights and the algorithms and the millions. Kathleen, smiling. Holding the thing that made the thing that changed everything.

Persephone watched her and felt a need she couldn't name — to remember this, to hold it, as if the holding might not last.

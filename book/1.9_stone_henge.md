# Chapter 1.9 — Stone-HENGE

> *"Being known feels so much like being held that the body can't tell the difference."*
> — Science & the Cult of Personality

---

The world ended on a Tuesday in March and nobody she knew died.

That was the strange thing — the strangeness of it, the way the end of the world arrived not as fire or flood but as a press conference. The governor on a screen. Schools are closed. Stay home. Her dad watched it in the living room with his arms crossed and said "Well, shit" with the matter-of-factness of a man who looked like he'd survived worse, and her mom stood behind the couch with her hand on her mouth and her eyes doing the thing they did — the small tightening, the blink that lasted a beat too long — and Persephone sat on the stairs with her phone and watched the three of them become the whole world.

That was March 2020. She was sixteen.

---

The first week was funny.

Funny because it was absurd — school on a laptop, teachers figuring out Zoom with the energy of grandparents figuring out email, the entire infrastructure of junior year reduced to a grid of faces in rectangles. Funny because her dad treated it like a snow day that wouldn't end, cooking elaborate breakfasts and narrating the quarantine like a nature documentary: "And here we observe the American family in its natural habitat, slowly losing its mind." Funny because Kathleen sent her a video every morning — Kathleen's face, close-up, whispering some new conspiracy theory about how the virus was actually a plot by Big Hand Sanitizer — and the videos were stupid and perfect and they made Persephone laugh so hard she had to press her face into the pillow so her parents wouldn't hear her at 7 AM.

The second week was less funny. The third week was just the world.

Her bedroom became the studio full-time.

The fairy lights. The tripod. The phone. She'd been posting daily before the lockdown and she posted daily after it and nothing changed about the process — same room, same lights, same girl, same dance — but everything changed about the audience. Everyone was home. Everyone was on their phones. Everyone was watching. The numbers, which had been climbing since December, went vertical in a way that made the previous vertical look flat. She couldn't keep track. She stopped trying. The numbers were weather now — something happening around her that she couldn't control or predict, and the weather was a hurricane, and the hurricane was her face on ten million screens.

Sergey's music did the same thing. A solo electronic artist who could produce and perform entirely from his bedroom was the platonic ideal of a lockdown musician. He didn't need a studio. He didn't need bandmates. He needed his loop station and his laptop and his bedroom and the world had just made bedrooms the only rooms that existed. His Spotify numbers climbed the way hers did — not because of each other, not anymore, but because the algorithm had found them both and the algorithm was hungry and the lockdown fed it.

Kathleen's bedroom was just a bedroom.

She didn't create. She didn't produce. She watched. She supported. She texted "that's amazing!" and the exclamation mark never wavered and the girl behind the exclamation mark was sitting in her house watching her two best friends build empires from across town. The physical proximity that kept her central — the body on the bed, the hand on the phone, the presence in the room — was gone. The tripod had replaced her hands. The screen had replaced her face. She was the girl who held the phone, and the phone didn't need holding anymore.

And she couldn't sneak out.

Kathleen's parents were the kind of parents who meant it when they said stay home. The kind who checked the doors. Who counted the hours. Who ran the household like rules were the point. Lockdown in the Unckles household was *lockdown.* A sixteen-year-old stayed in her house when the world said stay in your house, and that was that.

Persephone's parents were doing their own thing. George was on the phone with his sister, with his coworkers, with anyone who would listen to him narrate the apocalypse. Rosemary was cleaning things that were already clean and watching the news with the volume too low and doing the thing she did when the news was bad — making the house perfect, as if perfection could hold. Neither of them noticed their daughter's window opening at midnight. Neither of them noticed it closing at 3 AM.

Sergey's parents — both academics, both brilliant, both more likely to be found arguing about Foucault at midnight than checking whether their son had company — didn't notice their son had a visitor in his bedroom at all.

---

The brand was wrong and she could feel it.

She was sitting on the bathroom floor at 2 AM, scrolling her own comments, the tile cold through her pajama shorts. The phone's blue glow on her knees. Thousands of strangers telling her she was beautiful. She read them until the word stopped meaning anything — beautiful beautiful beautiful — until it was just a shape, just letters, just a sound someone made at a girl they'd never met.

Not wrong the way a lie is wrong — wrong the way a shoe is wrong when it's almost your size. It fit. It walked. It just didn't feel like her foot. The TikTok Persephone — dance, smile, fairy lights, trending sounds — was a version of her that was real enough to believe and flat enough to hurt. A pressed flower that looked like a flower and wasn't one. Girl-next-door charm. America's sweetheart. Natural and effortless and relatable. The descriptions built a person and the person had her face and nothing else.

She could feel the parts of her the camera couldn't see. The Sheepey bits. The princess riffs. The way she talked in the car — the observations that arrived without warning and landed without explanation and made Kathleen laugh and made Sergey stare. The mind behind the dancer. The storyteller behind the smile. None of that was on camera. The algorithm had found the body and the body was enough and the mind was in the bedroom with the door closed, talking to nobody.

She didn't know how to fix it. The thing the description was missing didn't fit in a thirty-second dance video. You couldn't do Sheepey to a trending sound. You couldn't tell a princess riff in fifteen seconds with a filter. The format was a box and the interesting parts of her didn't fit in the box and she was inside the box now and the box was getting smaller and she didn't have the words for this — she had the feeling, the off-ness, the crooked picture, the note slightly out of tune, and the feeling had no vocabulary and the vocabulary had no platform.

---

Sergey saw it.

He said it the way he said everything that mattered — precisely, without sentiment, with the surgical accuracy of someone who took things apart for a living and had just taken apart the most famous girl in Beaverton.

"You're giving them the dance," he said. "You're not giving them the voice."

They were on FaceTime. His face in the blue light of his monitors, her face in the red-gold of her fairy lights. Two colors on two screens. She was lying on her bed and he was at his desk and the observation landed in her chest before her brain could classify it.

"The dance is — it's beautiful. It works. But it's half. The thing you do — the *thing* — the Sheepey thing, the castle thing, the way you talk about things — that's not on camera. You're giving them the body and keeping the mind and the mind is the interesting part."

She didn't say anything. She looked at his face on the screen — the high hairline, the skinny bones, the eyes that were doing the thing they did when he'd figured something out, bright and certain and already three steps past the revelation, the smile that reminded her vaguely of George Clooney — and she felt something shift. Not a feeling. A recognition. Like hearing a sound you'd been hearing for months and suddenly identifying it as music.

"So what do I do?" she said.

"Instagram," he said. "TikTok stays dance. Instagram becomes the voice. Different platform, different content, different audience. You talk."

"I talk."

"You talk. You do the thing you do in the car. The observations. The riffs. The — you know. The you that isn't dancing."

"The me that isn't dancing," she repeated, and she was smiling, and the smile wasn't the camera smile — it was the real one, the one that lived in the space between performing and being, the one Kathleen saw when they were alone and nobody was watching.

---

She started making videos on Instagram.

The first one she almost deleted. She sat on her bed with the fairy lights behind her — the same room, the same glow, the tripod in the same spot — but instead of standing up to dance she just looked at the camera and talked. About a dream she'd had where all the stones at Stonehenge turned out to be sheep standing very still. She said it the way she said everything — as if it were the most natural thing in the world, as if of course stones were sheep, as if the only surprising thing was that nobody had noticed. She watched the playback and her face on the screen looked different from the dance videos. Looser. Stranger. More like the face Kathleen saw when they were alone. She almost deleted it. She posted it instead.

The comments were different. Not *you're so beautiful* and *queen* — people were quoting things she'd said back to her. *"The only surprising thing was that nobody had noticed" — this girl gets it.* They were listening. Not just watching. Listening the way Kathleen listened when Persephone did a Sheepey bit, the way Sergey listened when she said something that made his system stutter. Except these were strangers, thousands of them, and they were hearing the voice.

She made more. Not dances. Not lip syncs. She sat in her bedroom and she *talked.* About things. Whatever things — the weirdness of lockdown, her dad's pancakes, the observations that arrived fully formed and landed without preamble. The Sheepey sensibility softened for a public audience. Her take on things. Stories. Riffs. The mind behind the dancer, finally on camera.

When she talked, you listened. And the listening felt like being addressed — the same gift, the same presence that made the dance videos work, but more potent when it carried words. Whatever she had went through the glass, and it went through even harder when it carried her voice.

The Instagram grew fast. A different audience — slightly older, slightly more engaged, the kind of followers who watched a video three times and sent it to their friends with "you have to see this girl."

Sergey built the architecture. She filled it with herself.

Kathleen watched the new videos from across town and texted: *omg the Stonehenge dream one 😂😂😂 you're a genius.*

And she was right. And she meant it. And the genius had been built in Sergey's studio at midnight, with his analytical mind shaping her instinctive voice into something the platform could hold, and Kathleen didn't know that, and nobody told her, and the exclamation marks kept coming.

---

She started sneaking out in April.

Not because of a plan. Because the FaceTime sessions had limits — the screen flattened the conversation the way it flattened everything, and there were things she wanted to say that needed a room, not a rectangle. She wanted to hear his new tracks on his speakers, not through her phone's tinny little output. She wanted to sit in the studio and watch him build a loop from nothing, the way she used to watch Kathleen frame a shot — with the specific pleasure of watching someone do the thing they were made for.

She went out her window. Her bedroom was on the ground floor — one of the things she'd loved about the house since they'd moved in, the way the window opened straight onto the side yard, the lawn right there, no drop, no climb, just a leg over the sill and you were out. From the yard it was a fifteen-minute walk through empty streets to Sergey's house, and empty streets in lockdown were the emptiest streets she'd ever seen — no cars, no people, just the orange glow of streetlights on pavement that nobody was using. She walked through the silence with her hood up and her hands in her pockets and the night air was the first air that had moved across her skin in weeks, the first wind, and it felt like being let out of a box.

She didn't ask Kathleen to come. Not because she was excluding her — because she knew Kathleen couldn't. The Unckles household was sealed. Kathleen's parents checked. Kathleen's parents counted. And the thing Persephone felt when she thought about this — the thing that lived in the space between guilt and relief — was too complicated to name, so she didn't name it. She just went.

---

Sergey's bedroom studio at midnight was all blue light and cable.

The box with the colored buttons at the center of his desk — five little lights in a row, glowing like a dashboard for something she didn't drive. The pedal on the floor like a doorstep to somewhere. His laptop propped on a stack of magazines, the screen full of shapes she didn't have names for — waveforms, sliders, tiny windows inside windows. The microphone on its cheap stand, the one held together with electrical tape. Some kind of dial thing wedged between his textbooks. Cables everywhere — tangled across the desk, snaking over the floor, the nervous system of a teenager's one-room empire. The mess of someone who organized sound and nothing else.

She sat on his bed. The only place to sit that wasn't the desk chair, and the desk chair was his. The bed was unmade — it was always unmade, she'd never once seen it made, as if the concept of a made bed had simply never occurred to him. She sat cross-legged against the wall, the way Kathleen used to sit on her bed, and the echo was there — she felt it, filed it, didn't name it.

They worked on her content. He helped her shape the Instagram videos — not the aesthetic, she had her own eye, but the structure. Which thoughts to lead with. How to open. Where the turn was. She'd say something and he'd say "That — but start with the image, not the idea" or "The punchline is the quiet part, not the loud part" and he was right, he was always right about architecture, and she'd do it again and the second version was better and they'd watch it back together on his laptop, her face in the blue light of his screen, and the face on the screen looked like her in a way the TikTok face didn't. The mind was visible. The person was there.

The sessions ran late. Midnight became 1 AM. 1 AM became 2. They talked about things that didn't fit on FaceTime — the weird loneliness of being watched by millions, the gap between the description and the person, the specific isolation of being sixteen and famous and stuck in a house with parents who saw the fame and not the girl. He understood this — or seemed to. He'd told her about the Spotify comments that quoted his most private lyrics back at him. The Reddit thread that got "Enough to See By" exactly wrong and exactly right. He described it the way she felt it: the feeling of being seen by strangers who couldn't see you.

They were the only two people in Beaverton who knew what this felt like. Possibly the only two people their age anywhere. The compression of lockdown plus the expansion of fame plus the isolation of being sixteen and extraordinary — nobody else had those coordinates. Nobody else was standing at that intersection. They talked about it the way explorers talk about a landscape nobody else has seen: with the intimacy of shared discovery, with the shorthand of people who don't need to explain the terrain because they're both standing in it.

They talked about things they didn't talk about with Kathleen. Not because they were excluding her. Because she didn't have the reference points. She wasn't famous. She wasn't creating. She wasn't inside the machine. The conversations they had — about what it meant to be seen by strangers, about the architecture of a self that existed on two platforms simultaneously, about the loneliness of being the most-watched version of yourself — were conversations Kathleen couldn't enter. Not because she wasn't smart enough. Because she hadn't lived it.

Kathleen's texts arrived while she was in his studio.

*Hey what are you up to?*

She typed back *working on stuff with Sergey* and the reply came fast, the way Kathleen's replies always came: *oh fun! tell him I said hi 💕*

The exclamation mark. The heart. The speed of the response — no hesitation, no pause, no gap between reading the message and answering it. Kathleen on the other side of town, in her sealed house, with her strict parents and her monitored doors, texting her best friend who was in her boyfriend's bedroom at midnight with what sounded like the enthusiasm of a girl who had never once considered that this was anything other than what it appeared to be. Two friends working. Her boyfriend helping her best friend. The triangle functioning the way it was supposed to function, with everyone in their role and everyone happy and the exclamation marks proving it.

Persephone read the text and felt the distance.

She didn't want it to feel like distance. She wanted Kathleen on the bed — this bed, any bed, cross-legged, holding the phone, saying "that one" and "again" and "oh my God, yes." She wanted the bouncing and the screaming when the numbers ticked over. She wanted the girl who wrapped presents badly on purpose. And the worst part — the part that made this a tragedy instead of a choice — was that Kathleen would have been here. Kathleen would have sat on this bed and held the phone and they would have made room for her and the triangle would have held. The geometry didn't change because anyone chose to change it. It changed because Kathleen's parents checked the doors and Persephone's didn't, and that accident — that mundane, stupid, blameless accident of parenting — was enough to redraw a triangle into a line.

She texted back: *he says hi!! we're working on the instagram stuff*

The double exclamation mark. Matching Kathleen's energy. The small performance of normalcy, the small lie of punctuation — everything is fine, everything is the same, your best friend is in your boyfriend's bedroom at midnight and it's just work, the way it's always been just work.

---

Months passed inside the lockdown the way months pass inside a dream — shapeless, compressed, each day identical to the last until you looked up and realized that April had become June had become August and the trees had leafed and the light had changed and you'd been inside the whole time, watching the seasons through glass.

She went to his studio three or four nights a week. The walk through the empty streets. The window. The lawn. The fifteen minutes of wind and silence and the orange streetlights painting everything the color of a world that had stopped moving. She'd arrive at his house and the side door would be unlocked — he left it unlocked for her now, a small fact that neither of them commented on — and she'd go up the stairs quietly, past the closed door of his parents' bedroom where the academics slept the deep sleep of people absorbed in things more interesting than their son's social life, and she'd push open his door and the blue light would hit her face and he'd be at the loop station, building something, and he'd look up and nod and she'd sit on the bed and they'd work.

The Instagram kept growing. The videos got sharper, tighter, more her. Sergey's structural mind and her instinctive voice had found a rhythm — he built the rooms and she walked into them and the rooms fit and the voice carried and the audience multiplied. She talked about dreams and about her dad and about the time she and Kathleen invented a character named Sheepey who was a drunk sheep from Stonehenge — she said this on camera, she gave the internet a piece of the real her, and the video got more engagement than any dance she'd ever posted. The internet wanted the mind. The internet had been waiting for the mind. Sergey had been right.

She watched his new tracks take shape. Sat on the bed with her knees up and listened to the loop station build a cathedral from nothing — the click of the pedal, the first loop locking in, the second layer blooming on top, the third adding a dimension nobody predicted. She heard the music the way she heard everything about him — involuntarily, completely, with the same instinct for what was working and what wasn't that she brought to a Sheepey bit. "The second loop is fighting the third one," she'd say. "That's the point, right? They don't resolve." And he'd look at her with that expression — the one that said *you just named the thing I spent three hours trying to name* — and the look lasted a beat too long and she filed it and didn't name it.

She filed a lot of things and didn't name them.

The way his hand brushed hers when he passed her the headphones. The way he watched her face when she listened to a new track — not watching for approval, watching the way you watch weather, involuntarily, drawn. The way their conversations at 2 AM had a different quality than their conversations at noon — softer, less structured, the architecture of his mind relaxing into something that felt almost like the way she thought. The way she caught herself thinking about what she'd tell him while she was alone in her room during the day. The way his studio had started to feel like a second home, the blue light a second color, the cables and the loop station and the unmade bed as familiar to her now as the fairy lights and the tripod in her own room.

She noticed all of this. She noticed everything — that was her whole deal, she noticed things the way other people breathed, involuntarily and completely. And she filed it. And she didn't name it. Because naming it would make it a thing and she didn't want it to be a thing. They were friends. They were creative partners. They were two kids building empires side by side in a pandemic and the closeness was circumstantial and the circumstance was a global catastrophe and when the world reopened the closeness would settle back into its proper shape, which was the triangle, which was the three of them, which was Kathleen on the bed and Sergey at the desk and Persephone in the middle where she'd always been.

She told herself this. She almost believed it.

---

September.

Six months of lockdown. The trees outside Sergey's window were starting to turn — summer had passed while everyone was inside, the seasons changing without permission, without witnesses, the world going on about its business regardless of what the humans were doing in their sealed little rooms.

She climbed in through the side door. Up the stairs. Past the parents. Into the blue light.

He was at the loop station. She could see it from the doorway — his back to her, his shoulders hunched in the way they hunched when he was deep in something, the headphones on, his head bobbing slightly to a rhythm she couldn't hear. She stood in the doorway for a moment and watched him. The skinny back. The high hairline. The way his hands moved across the little row of knobs and sliders — fast, precise, the same hands that moved when he explained McGilchrist, building something visible in the air.

He turned. He saw her. And his face did something she hadn't seen before — or hadn't let herself see before, or had filed so many times without naming that the filing system had overflowed. He looked at her the way you look at someone you've been waiting for. Not surprised. Not casual. *Waiting.*

"Hey," she said.

"Hey." He pulled the headphones off. "I made something."

"You always make something."

"This is different." He swiveled in the desk chair and faced her and the blue light caught the bones of his face — the George Clooney smile, the jaw that made sense when the rest of him didn't — and his expression was the expression of a boy holding a gift he wasn't sure would be received. Nervous. Which was not a word she associated with Sergey. Sergey was certain. Sergey was the boy who explained McGilchrist to a room and believed every word. Sergey didn't do nervous.

"I don't know if it works," he said. "But I made it for you."

She sat on the bed. Cross-legged. Back against the wall. The position she always took, the position Kathleen used to take on her bed, the echo she always felt and never named.

"Play it," she said.

---

He didn't press play. He built it.

That was the thing about the loop station — the thing that made his live performances different from pressing a button on Spotify. He built the song in front of you. Layer by layer. Each loop added by hand, in real time, the click of the pedal marking each new addition like a heartbeat. You watched the architecture go up. You watched the cathedral assemble itself from a single brick.

The first loop: a plucked sound. Simple. Almost like a music box — something delicate and slightly wobbly, like a lullaby played by someone who'd had a few. A G that rang and faded and rang and faded, cycling, patient, the sonic equivalent of a rocking chair. The loop locked in with the click of the pedal and the sound began to repeat, and the repetition was the foundation, and the foundation was already slightly drunk.

Then his voice.

And his voice was doing something she had never heard it do.

He was singing in the Sheepey voice.

Not imitating Persephone talking about Sheepey. Not doing an impression, not playing it for laughs, not approximating the accent the way her dad did — enthusiastic and wrong, *well, Sheepey ol' chap.* Sergey was letting Sheepey *speak.* For the first time. Nobody had ever done that — not her, not Kathleen. They'd talked about him in third person for years, narrated his opinions, reported his complaints about modernity and the declining quality of modern tourism, but they'd never given him a voice. Sheepey was always *he thinks* and *he says* and *he'd rather not,* always at one remove, always described from outside. The slightly posh, slightly drunk, deeply dignified sheep from Stonehenge who had opinions about everything and feelings about nothing — except when he did, except when the feelings arrived sideways — had never spoken for himself.

Nobody knew Sheepey well enough to try. You had to know the pauses, the inflections, the specific way the dignity cracked when something real came through, the way the posh voice thinned at the edges when Sheepey was feeling something he meant. You had to have been in the car. You had to have been at the stones. You had to have heard a thousand Sheepey bits across a thousand afternoons to know where the comedy lived and where it opened up into something else.

Sergey had been there. He'd been listening.

The Sheepey voice, processed through the loop station, layered through whatever he did on the laptop, became something else — not a joke, not a bit, but a voice. A character. A person singing with the total sincerity of an animal who didn't know he was supposed to be funny. The same sincerity as Virtue the Cat. The same unguarded, unironic, devastatingly direct voice that narrated without protection, that said the real thing because it didn't know there was a fake thing, that told the truth the way animals tell the truth — by not knowing how to lie.

The first words, looped and layered, the Sheepey voice slightly posh and slightly cracked:

*I was on a shelf, you know. Between a tea towel — rather inferior — and a snow globe of questionable taste.*

She almost laughed. Almost. The laugh started in her chest and then something else arrived — something underneath the laugh, something that recognized what he was doing before her mind could classify it — and the laugh didn't finish. It stayed in her chest. Waiting.

The loop layered. His voice doubled, tripled — the Sheepey choir, three versions of the same dignified drunk, harmonizing in intervals that shouldn't have worked but did because the wrongness was the rightness, the slight wobble of each voice making the harmony feel alive instead of precise. The pulsing beat arrived underneath — that primal, Animal Collective throb, the one that hit your sternum before your brain caught up — and the comedy and the gravity began to coexist, the way they coexisted in Persephone, the way they coexisted in Sheepey himself: ridiculous and real and full of feeling he'd rather you didn't notice.

*I hadn't a name. Hadn't a thought. I was — how to put it — inventory. A copy. One of several dozen, I'm told, though I prefer not to dwell.*

A copy. Sheepey was a copy — price tag and polyester and a face stitched on by a machine in a factory, one of several dozen on a shelf in a gift shop in Wiltshire, indistinguishable, uncounted, the kind of thing you walked past on the way to the real souvenirs. He wasn't nobody. He was nothing. He didn't exist as a self. He was inventory.

The loop built. Another layer — a low hum, a drone, something that vibrated in the floor and rose through the bed frame into her bones. The Sheepey voice above it, dignified, measured, holding itself together the way Sheepey always held himself together, with the determined composure of someone who knew that dignity was all he had and would rather die than let you see it slip:

*And then a girl picked me up.*

The beat pulsed. The drone hummed. The Sheepey choir held the note — three voices on one word, *up,* the vowel hanging in the blue-lit air.

*She held me. And I heard my name for the first time.*

The dignity cracked. Not dramatically — the way it always cracked with Sheepey, the way it cracked in the car and on the couch and in the thousand small moments where the character stopped being a character and became a confession. The posh voice thinned. The vowels softened. The drunk sheep from Stonehenge was trying to say something that drunk sheep from Stonehenge are not equipped to say, and the trying was the song, and the song was breaking her open.

*I shan't bore you with the details of what it's like to go from — well, from inventory to person. It's rather a lot. One moment you're polyester and the next you're someone with opinions about the weather and a complicated relationship with modernity and — dignity. She gave me dignity. Which is a terrible gift, really, because once you have it you can't put it down and it's far too heavy to carry with any grace, but she gave it to me and I carry it and I wouldn't — I wouldn't trade it. Not for anything. Not for a better shelf. Not for a snow globe of superior taste.*

Persephone's hands were in her lap. She was very still. The kind of still that is the opposite of the yurt — not protective, not held, but open. Gathered. Receiving. The arms of her attention wider than they'd been in months, wider than the platform allowed, wider than the fairy lights and the trending sounds and the thirty-second boxes the algorithm put her in. She was open and the song was pouring in and she couldn't close and she didn't want to close.

The loops built. The Sheepey choir swelled — four voices now, five, each one adding a layer to the gratitude that Sheepey was trying so hard not to show, the thank you that kept leaking through the complaints about tea towels and the observations about the stones and the commentary on the state of modern sheep. He tried to say it sideways. He tried to say it through indirection. But the thank you was too big for indirection. It kept arriving, direct and undeniable, breaking through the posh voice the way water breaks through a crack in stone:

*She looked at me and I became someone.*

*Not gradually. Not in pieces. She arrived at me the way she arrives at everything — whole, complete, without a map — and I was real. I was a person with a name and a past and a drinking problem and I was REAL and she did that. She did that by looking. She does that. She looks at things and they become real. She looked at a castle and gave it a princess. She looks at a camera and ten million people feel seen. That's — that's her gift, you see. That's what she does. She makes things real by seeing them.*

The music was inside her now. The pulse in her ribs, the drone in her bones, the Sheepey voice — Sergey's voice, doing the thing she did, being the character she built, narrating with the sincerity of an animal who didn't know how to lie — filling the blue room and replacing the air with something she couldn't breathe and couldn't stop breathing.

*But nobody sees her.*

The beat dropped. The choir went quiet. One voice. Sheepey alone, small, the posh accent barely holding, the dignity in ruins:

*Nobody thanks the girl who gives everything life for the life she gives. Nobody holds the mirror up to the mirror. And I'm just a sheep on a shelf — was just a sheep on a shelf — but I know what she gave me and I know what it cost her and I know that nobody — nobody in ten million — sees the girl who sees everyone.*

The silence after was louder than the song.

The loops had stopped. Or they hadn't stopped — they were still cycling, the plucked G still ringing, the drone still humming through the floor, but the voice had stopped and the room was full of everything the voice had said and the silence was the space left by the words and the space was enormous.

She looked at him.

He was looking at her. Across the blue-lit room, from the desk chair to the bed, two and a half meters of cable-strewn carpet and six months of midnight sessions and something she hadn't let herself see — or had been seeing and hadn't named, or had named something else. Creative partnership. Artistic kinship. The bond of two people who understood each other's loneliness. He was looking at her with an expression she had never let herself read.

Her eyes were wet. Her chest was tight. Her body had gone completely still — not the stillness of the yurt, the held-breath stillness of a girl protecting someone she loved, but a different stillness. The stillness of being seen. The stillness of a door opening in a wall she didn't know was there. The stillness of the loneliest girl in Beaverton being handed back the part of herself the internet couldn't find.

She had been so lonely. Ten million people in the room and none of them could see her. Her dad saw his genes. Her mom saw worry. Kathleen saw her best friend — but from across town, through a screen, through exclamation marks that sounded like love and felt like distance.

And Sergey had just seen her. With a loop station and a pun and a drunk sheep singing her name.

She felt *known.* Known the way she was known before the fame, before the pressed flower, before the description swallowed the person. Known the way Kathleen knew her once — in the bedroom with the fairy lights, before knowing needed an output, before love needed a function.

The feeling was so enormous and so physical that it filled her body the way music fills a room — not in one place but everywhere, in her chest and her hands and her throat and behind her eyes. The being-known was indistinguishable from being held. She couldn't tell where the seeing ended and the touching began because they were the same thing, because being known by someone who knew the parts of you nobody else could see was a form of contact, was a hand on the face, was arms around the body, was closer than close.

She didn't want to sleep with him. She wanted to be *known.* But the wanting-to-be-known was so raw and so total and so desperate — six months of loneliness, six months of being the most-watched invisible girl in America — that when the distance between them closed she couldn't find the line. The line she'd drawn at Chepstow. The line the princess built on a staircase. The line that said *we are three, not two.* The line was gone. The loneliness had dissolved it. The being-seen had dissolved it. The body couldn't tell the difference between being known and being wanted and the gap between them closed — he leaned or she leaned or the space between them made a decision that neither of them made — and his face was close. His mouth. The blue light on his skin. The Emissary's color on the Emissary's face.

He kissed her. Or the distance between them became zero and the zero was a kiss. And the feeling of being seen was so enormous and so indistinguishable from being touched that she didn't stop him.

She didn't stop him. That's not the same as wanting him to start.

His hands were different from what she expected. She hadn't expected anything — she hadn't had time to expect, the distance closed before expecting was possible — but his hands were lighter than she would have guessed. Careful. The hands of someone who placed sounds precisely on a grid, who pressed pedals with the ball of his foot, who wrote in notebooks with tiny letters. His fingers on her collarbone felt like someone reading braille.

The unmade bed. The textbooks on the nightstand. The cables pressing into her back through the sheet. His skin was warm in a way that surprised her — she'd thought of him as cool, cerebral, blue-lit, but his body was warm and close and unfamiliar and the unfamiliarity was part of it, the strangeness of a body she knew so well in every other context and didn't know at all in this one. The loop station was still on, the last track still loaded, "Stone-HENGE" still cycling through the headphones that had slipped off the desk at some point and were playing to nobody — the sheep choir singing to an empty room, the grateful drunk sheep thanking a girl for giving him life, while the girl and the boy who wrote the song crossed a line on the other side of the blue light.

It was different from the yurt. In the yurt, Sergey was with Kathleen, and Persephone held still. She lay on the other bed and she didn't move and she barely breathed and the holding-still was the most violent act of love she had ever committed — a girl pressing herself into the dark to protect someone she loved from the knowledge that would destroy her.

Here she didn't hold still. Here Kathleen was across town, in her sealed house, with her checked doors, texting exclamation marks to a phone that was facedown on the nightstand and buzzing against the wood with the soft persistence of a girl who had no idea. And nobody held still. The movement — the not-holding-still — was the betrayal. The body that had once pressed itself into the dark to protect Kathleen was now in Kathleen's boyfriend's bed, moving, and the moving was the opposite of the yurt, the negative image, the thing she'd held against for so long that when she stopped holding the stopping felt like falling.

She didn't think about Kathleen while it happened. That was the worst part. She didn't think about her best friend. Not once. The loneliness was so big and the being-seen was so total that it swallowed everything else. The triangle, the line, the princess riff, the patch she'd built at Chepstow, the girl on the bed who said "perfect" and "that one" and "do it again" — all of it dissolved in the feeling of being known by someone who could also touch her.

And the sheep kept singing to nobody.

Afterward.

The blue light. The monitors still on, the screensavers not yet triggered, the waveforms on the laptop screen frozen in the shape of the last loop. The loop station humming. The room that was a studio and a bedroom and now something else — a place where a thing had happened that couldn't unhappen, a room that would always be this room now, the room where the triangle broke.

He was next to her. His hand on her arm. His breathing going slow and even, the breath of someone settling into something, arriving somewhere. She could feel the arrival in his body — the way his weight shifted toward her, the way his hand curled around her forearm with what felt like the certainty of someone who believed he was holding what he'd always wanted.

She stared at the ceiling. It was the wrong ceiling. Not her bedroom with the fairy lights and the red-gold glow — his ceiling, blue-white from the monitors, cool and flat and the color of classification, the color of the Emissary's territory. She was in his room. In his color. In his bed. She had crossed into his territory by way of a drunk sheep and she was lying in the light of his screens and the light was the wrong light and the ceiling was the wrong ceiling and the room was the wrong room.

She thought about Kathleen.

Not with guilt. Not yet. Guilt would come later — in waves, in the specific devastating detail of memory, with the face and the voice and the exclamation marks and the girl who wrapped presents badly on purpose and the girl who bounced on the bed when the numbers ticked over and the girl who sat cross-legged with the phone and said "ready?" and what she'd always heard as *I love you, I'm here, I see you,* every time, every single time, without ever once asking to be seen back. The guilt would come and it would be precise and it would take her apart.

Right now she thought about Kathleen the way you think about a sound you heard a long time ago and can't quite place. The memory of a frequency. The echo of a voice. Kathleen on the bed. Kathleen holding the phone. Kathleen's big doe eyes watching the playback with the focus she brought to everything she decided to care about — completely, without reservation. "That one." "Perfect." "Do it again."

*oh fun! tell him I said hi 💕*

The phone was on the nightstand. Facedown. Still buzzing, or not buzzing, she couldn't tell — the notifications had become white noise months ago, the phone was always vibrating, always alive with the attention of strangers, and somewhere in the stream of strangers was the one person who was not a stranger, the one person who had been on the bed before the tripod, who had held the phone before the algorithm, who had seen her before anyone.

She lay in the blue light next to a boy who thought she'd chosen him and she stared at the wrong ceiling and the sheep was still singing to nobody and the wind was somewhere else — not in this room, not in this sealed box of screens and cables and the wreckage of a triangle — the wind was outside, in the streets she'd walked through to get here, moving through the trees that were starting to turn, bending the leaves and letting go, the way wind does, the way wind always does, never grabbing anything, never holding on.

She was very still. The room was very quiet. Somewhere across town, in a house with checked doors and counted hours, a girl with big round eyes and a heart full of exclamation marks was probably falling asleep, and Persephone lay here knowing something Kathleen didn't.

La called Saturday night.

His phone was on the nightstand in the hotel room in Dallas and the screen lit up and his body registered the light before his mind registered the name. La. Not Persefoni. La called when the world needed managing, and the world only needed managing when the world had broken.

"Démion."

He sat up. The hotel room was dark and the Dallas skyline was flat through the window and La's voice was doing something it didn't do — shaking. La's voice was the most controlled instrument he knew after his own arm. This voice was not that voice.

"George is dead. Heart attack at his brother's house in Alabama. They took him to the hospital and he died in the cath lab."

He didn't say anything. His body was still. George. Dead. Alabama. The words arrived in his chest like a hit on the field — physical first, meaning second.

"Where is she?"

"I'm booking her a flight. LAX to Birmingham. I'm flying out of Orlando."

He sat in the dark hotel room in Dallas and held the phone and the phone was warm from the nightstand and the warmth was the only real thing. George. The big man, the warm voice, the *that's my boy* on the phone after every game. George was dead and the word *dead* was a word that didn't fit in the same world as the man it was about.

"I have a game tomorrow."

He said it and heard it and the hearing was strange. The game. Tomorrow. Cowboys. The schedule that had organized his life since he was six years old and his tío said *este niño* in the yard in Hialeah.

"I know," La said. And then, quieter: "I'll handle this. I'll call you."

He hung up. He sat in the dark. The Dallas skyline was out there — buildings, lights, the flat sprawl of a Texas city at night. The game was in eighteen hours. His body was already calibrated — the shake, the stretching, the protocol that preceded every game, the machine's preparation for the machine's work. George was dead and his body was calibrated for football and the calibration didn't stop because the calibration had never stopped.

He lay back down. He closed his eyes. He didn't sleep.

La called again at 6:47 AM. Sunday morning. He was already awake — had been awake since her first call, the body still in the hotel bed, the Dallas ceiling above him.

"Rosemary's in the ER. Her heart — they think it's a heart attack. Stress cardiomyopathy. They're moving her to the cardiac ICU."

He held the phone. George was dead and now Rosemary's heart was failing. The phone was warm.

"Persefoni drove her at four in the morning. I just got here. I'm handling it."

"I'll come."

"The game is in eight hours."

Neither of them said anything. He could come now. No one would question it. La had to know that. But his body was already doing the other thing — the schedule, the machine running its protocol even now, even with George dead, even with Rosemary in the ICU, even with the phone warm in his hand.

"I'll come after," he said.

"Okay." Quiet. Something in it. "I'll tell her."

He hung up. George was dead and Rosemary was in the ICU and the game was in eight hours and he was going to play.

---

The game.

He dressed. He drank the shake — avocado, almond butter, plant protein, the taste like chalk and discipline. He rode the bus to the stadium and the bus was full of large men in headphones, the coiled stillness of bodies waiting to be released. He was one of them. He was the center of them.

The tunnel. The concrete. The roar compressed into a vibration in his molars. He ran onto the field and the sky opened — the Texas sky, blue and enormous, not a roof, not the translucent thing, but actual sky — and seventy thousand people were there and George was dead.

He threw. Completion. The ball leaving his fingers with the quiet spiral that meant everything was right. Except everything was not right and the fingers knew it and the spiral was a fraction tight — a tension the leather could feel even if the broadcast couldn't. He threw again. Completion. The pocket held. The reads came.

The second quarter. Shotgun formation, third and seven. He took the snap and his feet dropped and the pocket was good and McConkey was running the out route and the window was open and his arm loaded and —

Nothing.

His hands didn't move. A half-second. Less than a half-second — a signal lost between the brain and the arm. His hands held the ball and the window was closing and the half-second was over and he threw and the ball arrived late. McConkey adjusted. McConkey caught it. The first down moved the chains. Nobody saw the half-second. A late throw that was caught was not a late throw.

His body knew. The throw was late because for a half-second his hands had been somewhere else — not in Alabama, not at the hospital, not anywhere his mind could name. The body had gone there without permission and the going was new.

He played the rest of the game. The stats wouldn't show it. The body showed it — to itself, to the hands, to the feet.

The Cowboys lost. The Chargers won. He walked off the field and into the tunnel and the tunnel was cool and George was still dead and he had played a football game.

---

La had texted during the game. Rosemary stabilized. Persefoni was at St. Vincent's, holding it together. *Come when you can.*

He stood in front of his locker in his pads. The locker room was emptying around him — bodies moving toward showers, toward the postgame. He stood in his pads and the bodies moved around him and George was dead and he had played.

The big man. The voice. The *that's my boy.* The Alabama hat and the arms that went wide in every doorway and the hug that felt like coming home. The man who had called after every game for five years. The man who had walked through the condo door and said *THERE he is* and the voice had hit Démion's chest like a greeting from a man he'd known his whole life.

He took off the pads. He showered. He dressed. He booked a flight to Birmingham. Pack the bag. Walk to the car. Drive to the airport.

He flew to Birmingham. He landed. He drove to St. Vincent's.

The hospital was a labyrinth — sky bridges and cafeterias and hallways that led to other hallways that led to doors you had to be buzzed through. Twenty minutes from the parking lot. His body moved through the corridors and the corridors shrank around him — the size, the shoulders, the physical fact of six-six in a space built for smaller people. A nurse looked up. An orderly stepped aside.

The last hallway. Olive green walls — a green from another decade, institutional, tired. Handrails running the full length, wide white oak, the wood smooth from years of hands. The hallway smelled like antiseptic and the fluorescent light was the blue-white that belongs to hospitals and nothing else.

He found her in the hallway.

She was sitting in a chair outside a room. Her legs were pulled up under her and her arms were wrapped around herself and her hair was wrong — flat, unwashed, the curls compressed by a flight and a night and a day of holding her mother's hand. She looked up and her green eyes found him and the eyes were red and the red was the rawness of a woman who had been crying for hours and had stopped — not because the crying was over, he could see that much, but because something in her had simply given out.

He didn't say anything. His arms opened and she stood and walked into them.

*Aquí.*

He held her. She was 130 pounds and she felt like less. He pulled her against his chest and her face pressed into the space below his collarbone and he felt her breathing change — from tight and controlled to shaking, broken, the sound of a woman letting go.

She cried. He held her and she cried and the crying was not the controlled kind — it was the sound that starts in the chest before it reaches the mouth, the sound that had been waiting for something solid enough to hold it.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above them. The machines beeped in the room behind the closed door where Rosemary was monitored and alive. The corridor smelled like antiseptic and plastic and underneath it the warm alive scent at the top of her head, the scent he'd been breathing since the hurricane night.

---

He flew back to LA with her. And with Rosemary.

La had arranged everything — the flights, the discharge paperwork, the logistics of transporting a woman whose heart had literally broken from a hospital in Birmingham to her daughter's house in Santa Monica. La handled the world the way a great coordinator handled a game plan: so the quarterback could do his job.

His job was Persefoni. He knew it before the thought, before the analysis — the body reading the field and telling him where to go.

He packed a bag at his Bel Air house. One bag. Clothes, shoes, the basics. He drove to Santa Monica — thirty minutes, the same distance that had always separated them, the bay of independence she maintained, the space that was hers. He walked through the door of her two-bedroom near the bluffs and he put the bag down and he didn't leave.

The house was small for him. The couch was too short — his feet hung off the end when he lay down, the armrest hitting him at the shoulder blades instead of the neck. The shower was built for a woman who was 5'8" and the showerhead hit him in the chest. The bed was a queen — her bed, her sheets, the mattress chosen for a body half his size — and his body filled it completely, the 250 pounds taking up more than half, his arm reaching across to find her hip in the dark, the reaching a reflex that preceded sleep.

His shoes by the front door took up half the entryway. His jacket on the hook made the other jackets look small. He filled her space by being too much for it, by making the rooms feel smaller. George had done the same thing — but George's too-much was warmth and noise. Démion's too-much was body and silence.

Rosemary was in the guest room. The guest room that Persefoni had prepared for her parents' visit — the new sheets, the candle on the nightstand, the Alabama magnets on the fridge. The room had been ready for George and Rosemary together, the two of them, the couple that was a visual event. Now the room held Rosemary alone. Rosemary who was 5'2" and blonde and smaller than he'd ever seen her — the trying-smile gone, the sweetness still there but flattened, pressed flat.

Rosemary couldn't go home — anyone could see that. The bungalow in Gulfport was George's house — every room was George, the porch with his chair, the grill he tended like a garden, the coffee maker he'd claimed in every kitchen he'd ever entered, the newspaper on the table that he read with the physical conviction of a man who believed in paper. She flinched when someone mentioned the house. Her whole body flinched.

So she was here. In her daughter's guest room. In Santa Monica. The candle on the nightstand burned and wasn't replaced and burned out and the room smelled like wax.

---

The first week was the hardest. And then the second week was the hardest. And then the third week was the hardest and the hardest stopped being a superlative and became the temperature of the house.

Persefoni didn't get up. She stayed in the bed or on the couch and the movement between the two was the entire geography of her days — bed to couch, couch to bed, the thirty feet of hardwood between the bedroom and the living room the longest distance she traveled. She wore his shirts. The shirts were enormous on her — the size of him, the fabric that had been stretched by his shoulders now hanging off hers, the sleeves past her hands, the hem at her thighs. She disappeared inside them.

She didn't eat. He put food in front of her — plates, bowls, the same protein and vegetables that fueled his body now arranged for hers. She looked at the plate and didn't look at the plate and sometimes ate and sometimes didn't. He didn't push. He put the plate there.

He picked her up. This was the thing — the physical thing, the fact that lived at the center of the chapter his body was writing. She was on the bathroom floor one morning, curled against the tile, the cold white tile that smelled like cleaning products, and she was crying in a way that didn't have a beginning or a destination. He stood in the doorway and looked at her and his body didn't think. His body bent and his arms went under her — one behind her back, one under her knees — and he picked her up — 130 pounds, nothing, the same nothing as the tunnel after the opener, a warm light thing in his arms. Except she wasn't warm. She was cold from the tile and shaking and she pressed her face into his neck and the pressing was the same pressing as the tunnel and the pressing was different from the tunnel because the tunnel was victory and this was the opposite of victory and his arms were the same arms.

He carried her to the couch. He set her down. He pulled the blanket over her. He sat next to her and his arm went around her and she leaned into him — not choosing to, just yielding to the thing that was solid.

*Quédate.* Stay. The body's only instruction.

---

They watched Winnie the Pooh.

He didn't know how it started. One of them — Persefoni or Rosemary, he didn't know which — had put it on, and the screen filled with the Hundred Acre Wood and the warm yellow bear ambled through the trees and the voice — the narrator's voice, the gentle English voice that said *Now, Pooh was a bear of very little brain* — filled the room.

The room changed.

He felt it in their bodies before he understood it with his mind. Persefoni's breathing slowed. Rosemary, who had been sitting in the armchair with her legs folded under her and her eyes focused on something that wasn't in the room, turned toward the screen. The bear on the screen was talking about honey and the voice was warm and uncomplicated and the warmth was doing something that his body, for all its strength, could not do.

Something in the bear's voice. Something that landed in his chest the way George's voice landed — not the pitch, not the sound, but the warmth of it, the way the room settled when it spoke. The same thing George did when he walked through a door, arriving from somewhere else entirely.

He sat on the couch and didn't watch the screen. He watched them watch the screen. Persefoni on his left, leaned into him, the blanket over her legs, her eyes on the bear. Rosemary in the armchair, smaller than the chair, the afghan over her lap, her eyes on the bear.

They watched Mister Rogers.

The man in the cardigan. The man who changed his shoes at the door — the specific ritual of it, the sweater zipped, the sneakers replacing the dress shoes — and looked into the camera and said things that sounded like nothing and were everything. *You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you; and I like you just the way you are.*

Rosemary's breathing changed when he spoke. Démion felt it from across the room — the catch, the slight tremor, a body that seemed to recognize something. George said things like that. George said *Beautiful, baby* and *There she is* and *BABY GIRL*. Mister Rogers spoke to the camera with the same unguarded sincerity.

The crying paused when Mister Rogers spoke. Not stopped — paused. The two women went still and the man in the cardigan said gentle things and Démion sat on a couch that was too small for him and held.

They watched on repeat. The same episodes. The same voices. The same bear and the same man in the cardigan and the same gentle words cycling through the same gentle arcs. The episodes ended and started again and ended and started again and the repetition was the point. The blue light flickering in a darkened room where the curtains were drawn and the Pacific was invisible and the world outside the door had been suspended.

---

They didn't go outside.

Weeks. He lost track of how many. The front door opened when he left for games and closed when he came back and the opening and closing was the only punctuation the house had. Between the openings, the house was sealed — a capsule, a terrarium, the air inside growing stale because the air inside was the only air they could breathe. The air outside was the world and the world was the place where George wasn't and the not-being-there was what made the air outside unbreathable.

He opened a window once. A Tuesday. The air in the living room was thick and the staleness was becoming physical — a taste in the back of his mouth, a weight in his lungs, the specific claustrophobia of a body that was used to stadiums and practice fields and open sky. He opened the window and the Pacific air came through and the air was salt and clean and moving — the wind, the wind that moved through everything without seizing, without staying — and Persefoni looked up from the couch.

"Close it."

Two words. Quiet. Not angry, not demanding.

He closed it. The wind stopped. The staleness returned. He sat back down on the couch and his arm went around her and the episode continued — Pooh and Piglet walking through the woods, the warm voice narrating constantly, generously.

He learned to be still.

The first day, his legs wouldn't stop. He sat on the couch and his right knee bounced — the fast-twitch, the muscle memory of a body that had never been asked to do nothing. The second day, his hands. The third day, the whole body humming at a frequency only he could feel, the current running through 250 pounds of muscle that had been built for stadiums and was now deployed in a two-bedroom near the bluffs. The couch. The kitchen. The bedroom. The bathroom. The thirty feet of hardwood between the living room and the bed. His body in this house was a body with nowhere to go.

---

He tried to be George.

The body just moved toward the things George had done — the physical gestures, the domestic rituals that had organized the Minton household.

He grilled. On the small patio outside the kitchen — the Santa Monica patio, not the Gulfport porch, smaller, the Pacific air carrying different smells than the Gulf air, the grill itself a modest Weber he'd bought with cash from a hardware store on Lincoln Boulevard because someone needed to stand at the grill. George had stood at the grill. George had tended the grill with total attention — the charcoal, the timing, the running commentary about the char. Démion didn't know how to grill like George grilled. But his body could learn anything. He learned the heat — the way the coals went from black to white-edged, the smoke rising in thin columns that bent in the coastal air, the hiss of fat hitting the grate. His hands learned when to turn. His body stood in the smoke and the smoke got into his shirt and the shirt smelled like charcoal when he came back inside and the smell was the closest the house got to George. The plates came out and the food was good — not George's food, not the food that was accompanied by a running commentary about the char and the seasoning and the quality of the mesquite, but good food, hot food, food that he put in front of two women who sometimes ate and sometimes didn't.

He fixed things. The cabinet under the kitchen sink had a hinge that was loose and he fixed it — not because he was handy, not because he'd ever fixed a cabinet in his life, but because George would have fixed it. Démion walked into this house and saw the loose hinge and fixed it with a screwdriver he found in a drawer and the fixing took ten minutes and the ten minutes were the most useful he'd felt all week.

He stood in the kitchen. He made coffee. He poured it into mugs and brought one to Persefoni on the couch and one to Rosemary in the armchair and the bringing was George's gesture — George who made coffee in other people's kitchens as if the space had been waiting for him. Démion made coffee in Persefoni's kitchen and the mugs were warm and the kitchen was quiet.

The rooms were warm and quiet. George's rooms were warm and loud. The difference was everything.

He could feel it — the gap. His body read it like a coverage, the thing missing from the formation. The rooms had body in them. The rooms had warmth — 250 pounds of it. But the rooms didn't have sound. The rooms didn't have *BABY GIRL* or *Beautiful, baby* or *THERE he is*. The rooms didn't have George's voice filling every silence the way George filled every doorway.

He could see them hearing it — the silence. Persefoni's eyes drifting to the doorway when no one came through it. Rosemary's hands opening and closing around a mug that had gone cold. The silence in the rooms was not his silence — it was George's, the hole where the voice was supposed to be, and no amount of body could fill it. He could be the rock. He could not be the weather.

---

The crying came out of nowhere.

A Tuesday afternoon. An episode of Pooh — one they'd seen before, one about Piglet being frightened, the small anxious creature and the warm steady bear. The episode was playing and the room was still and Persefoni was leaned into him, the default position since the hospital corridor.

Her chest changed. He felt it before he heard it — a tremor, a shift in the rhythm of her breathing, the body signaling before the mouth caught up. A sound. Low, from the center of her. The sound grew and became crying and the crying had no trigger he could see — no scene, no memory, no word spoken. The grief just arrived — he could feel it in the way her weight shifted against him, sudden and total and unrelated to anything that was happening on the screen.

His arm tightened around her. He pulled her closer. The body's response — automatic, immediate, the same speed that found the open receiver, deployed now for this. She was against his chest and shaking.

Rosemary. The armchair. Rosemary heard the crying and her face changed — not crumbled, changed, the surface reorganizing — and then Rosemary was crying too. The house was small enough that no grief stayed private. Everything was heard. Everything was shared. The mother and the daughter yoked to the same absence, the same missing man, the same hole in the world that no amount of cartoon bears or men in cardigans could fill.

He held Persefoni with his left arm. He reached his right arm across the space between the couch and the armchair — the arm was long enough, the wingspan of a quarterback whose arms were measured at the combine, the span that threw sixty-yard passes, extended now across three feet of living room to rest on Rosemary's shoulder. He held them both. Two women, 130 pounds and 110 pounds, the combined weight less than his own.

The episode kept playing. The bear was talking about honey. The warm voice narrated the Hundred Acre Wood and the Wood was green and gentle and nothing in it had ever died. The bear and the frightened piglet walked through the trees and the trees didn't fall and the sky didn't darken and the story was kind and the women were crying and the man was holding and the room was lit by the blue glow of the screen and the room smelled like stale air and candle wax and grief.

This happened on a Tuesday. It happened again on Thursday. It happened Saturday morning at four AM — Persefoni starting in the dark, the crying waking him, the body responding before the mind was fully awake, the arms finding her by instinct, faster than consciousness. It happened at dinner — the food on the table, the forks in their hands, a word spoken or not spoken, and the grief arriving like a door opening onto a room that was always there behind the room they were in.

It happened for six months.

---

Game days.

He left the house at dawn. The house was dark — the curtains still drawn, the stale air still holding, the women still in the positions they'd been in when he'd gone to bed: Persefoni in the bed, Rosemary in the guest room, the house arranged around its grief. He dressed in the dark. He didn't shower — he'd shower at the facility. He put on his shoes by the door, the shoes that took up half the entryway, and he opened the front door and the outside hit him.

The air. The salt. The morning light doing the thing Santa Monica light did — arriving early, arriving golden, the city offering its beauty to anyone who was awake to receive it. The Pacific was right there — the ocean that had been invisible for weeks, the water that was fifty yards from the living room and might as well have been on the moon. He breathed the air and the breathing was the first deep breath his lungs had taken in days and the depth of it was a relief he didn't examine.

He drove to the facility. The drive was thirty minutes and the thirty minutes were the space between his two lives — the house where the curtains were drawn and the building where the lights were bright and the bodies were large and the purpose was clear. He pulled into the parking lot and the parking lot was full of trucks and SUVs and the lot was the lot of men who worked with their bodies and parked their vehicles broadly, without apology.

He dressed. He warmed up. He walked onto the field and the field was the field — the green, the lines, the geometry that had always made sense — and for three hours the body did what the body did. The machine turned on. The switch was reliable. The activation automatic.

But the practices. He missed practices. Not every practice — enough. Enough that the reps weren't there, the timing wasn't there, the daily recalibration that the body needed to maintain its precision wasn't happening. Practices were where the body stayed sharp — the repetition, the rhythm, the throwing to spots that receivers would occupy, the building and rebuilding of the neural pathways that made the game effortless. Without practice, the game was still excellent. The game was still the best in the league. But the body knew the difference between excellent and perfect and the difference was the reps he wasn't getting because the reps were at the facility and the facility was not where she was.

He drove back to the house after games. The thirty minutes in reverse — the facility receding, the parking lot emptying, the light changing from the stadium's artificial brightness to the highway's amber to the quiet dark of Santa Monica streets. He pulled into the driveway and sat in the car for a moment. One moment. The body between its two lives — the life it had just left, where it was the greatest, and the life it was about to enter, where it was needed.

He went inside. The door closed. The outside disappeared. The stale air and the television light and the women on the couch and the bear on the screen. He put his bag down. He took off his shoes. He sat on the couch — the couch that was too small, the couch that his feet hung off — and his arm went around her and the episode was already playing and the man in the cardigan was already speaking and the room was already arranged around its grief and his body took its position. The rock. The warm heavy thing on the couch next to two women watching children's television because children's television was the only voice kind enough.

He checked his phone after every game. Every game. The habit — the five-year habit, the body's expectation, the thumb moving to the screen before the mind could stop it. He looked at the phone and the phone was there and the call wasn't there. George's name wasn't on the screen. The voice that had arrived after every game — *THAT'S MY BOY* — the voice that had been as reliable as the game itself, as predictable as the snap count, was not there. The silence where the voice used to be was a small silence compared to the silences in the house but it was his silence, the one he owned, the one that belonged to the specific absence of a man who had called him son and meant it.

His thumb hovered over the phone. The body expecting the thing that wasn't coming. The tongue going to the space where the tooth used to be. He put the phone down. He put his arm around her. The episode continued.

---

George's absence was physical.

He noticed it with his skin and his hands and the internal compass that had always told him where things were in space.

George's phone calls — gone. The Sunday voice, the Monday voice, the voice that had no schedule because George didn't need a schedule to call someone he loved. The phone was silent now and the silence was a sound — a room that should have music and doesn't.

He went to Gulfport once, early in the weeks. La needed someone to check on the bungalow — the pipes, the mail, the physical fact of a house that was empty. He flew into Tampa and drove the thirty minutes southeast. He pulled onto the street for the first time without George at the other end.

The bungalow. The porch was empty. The chair where George sat with his coffee and his paper was there but the chair was wrong — a chair without a man is furniture, a chair with George in it was a throne, and the throne was empty and the kingdom was closed. The grill was cold. The grill George had tended every weekend — cold, the grate clean, the charcoal bin empty. The lemon tree in the yard moved in the wind — the leaves turning, the late-afternoon light catching them, the last red edge of a Gulf sunset bleeding across the grass — and the wind was the first wind he'd felt in weeks and the wind didn't know that George was dead. The wind moved through the yard the same way it had always moved — without grabbing, without staying — and the yard received it the same way it had always received it, and George's absence had not changed the wind and had not changed the yard and had changed everything.

He walked through the house. The rooms were too big. The rooms had always been small — small because George was 6'4" and filled them with his voice and his body and his warmth. George made rooms small by being too much for them. Without George the rooms were their actual size and their actual size was enormous. The coffee maker on the counter. The Gulfport Gabber — the weekly paper, the little paper for the little town, still on the table where he'd left it. The newspaper was open to a page Démion couldn't read from across the room and he didn't walk closer to read it because the page was George's page and the reading of the page was George's reading and some things were not his to finish.

He checked the pipes. He collected the mail. He locked the door. He drove back.

The body missed George. The body missed the big man like a landmark gone from the horizon — the thing that had been there every time you looked, so you always knew where you were. George had been the landmark. The big voice, the warm hug, the *that's my boy*. The body had navigated by him the way it navigated by hash marks on the field — instinctively, without thought.

The things were not there. The body noticed. The body kept noticing.

---

McConkey adjusted.

Démion could feel it — the young receiver's routes shifting by fractions, the timing of his breaks arriving a half-step earlier to account for the ball arriving a half-beat late. McConkey didn't say anything. McConkey was twenty-three years old and had been learning Démion's rhythms since training camp and the rhythms had changed and McConkey adjusted the way good receivers adjusted: silently, by feel.

The throws were still elite. The arm was still the arm — the instrument, the thing that did what nothing else in the history of the sport had done. But the precision had shifted. Not the mechanics — the mechanics were muscle memory, the body's library of motions encoded so deeply they couldn't be unlearned. The timing. The decision. The half-beat between seeing the window and throwing through it — the half-beat that used to be instantaneous, that used to be the thing that separated him from every other quarterback who had ever lived — was now a full beat. Sometimes. Not always. Not on every throw. But often enough that his body knew the machine was running on something less than full.

He wasn't practicing. The reps that maintained the timing, the repetition that kept the neural pathways clean — he wasn't doing them. He was on a couch in Santa Monica holding a woman who was watching Winnie the Pooh. The reps were at the facility and the facility was the other life and the other life was not the first life anymore.

The season ended. The Chargers missed the playoffs. The math of it — the wins, the losses, the tiebreakers, the conference — was unclear. Other teams had injuries. Other teams had their own collapses. The league was built to produce parity and parity meant that the difference between the playoffs and the couch was thin and the thin could have been anything: his absence from practice, the half-beat delay, the machine running bent. Or the conference. Or the schedule. Or the randomness of a league where the best quarterback alive didn't guarantee January.

He didn't analyze it. The season was over and the over-ness was a fact and the fact was filed — acknowledged, not engaged with, placed somewhere the body wouldn't have to look at it.

---

The offseason arrived and the vigil continued and the continuing was the hardest thing.

The game had been an interruption — three hours on Sundays, the machine turning on, the body's first language spoken briefly and then silenced by the drive back to Santa Monica, the stale air, the television, the couch. The interruption had been a relief he didn't name. Three hours of being the body he'd always been — the field, the reads, the arm — three hours of the thing he was best at, the thing that had organized his life since Hialeah, the thing that made sense.

Now the interruption was gone. The offseason was the season of nothing — no games, no Sundays, no three-hour reprieve where the body could be its first self. The offseason was supposed to be recovery and preparation — the body healing, the mind resetting, the machine being maintained for the next time the machine would run. Instead the offseason was the couch. The offseason was Pooh and Mister Rogers and the crying at four AM and the stale air and the curtains drawn and the Pacific invisible.

The body had no game. The body had the house. The house was the body's whole world now — the two-bedroom near the bluffs, the thirty feet of hardwood, the couch that was too small, the kitchen where he made coffee and grilled and fixed hinges and did the things George had done without the sound George had made. The body's world was 1,200 square feet of grief and the 1,200 square feet were smaller than any field he'd ever stood on.

He didn't leave. He didn't go to the facility. He didn't work out. The body that had been maintained every day of its adult life — the weight room at six AM, the stretching, the precise destruction and reconstruction of muscle — was not being maintained. He could feel it. Not weakness — the body was too strong for weakness — but a softening, a slight give in the muscles, the way a car that isn't driven settles into its suspension. The body was settling. The body was learning a new shape — the shape of a man who sat on a couch, the shape of a man who held, the shape of a man who was still.

For the first time, there was no football. There was no game to go to. There was no field to be on. There was only her and the house and the bear on the screen and the man in the cardigan and the grief that came out of nowhere and the holding and the holding and the holding.

The food arrived on the plate. The body picked her up off the floor. The body sat still. The body was the warm heavy thing on the couch that two women leaned into and the leaning didn't move him — because nothing moved him, because the body that absorbed hits from 260-pound linebackers could absorb this and not shift an inch.

The body held. Not once did it crack — not in the bathroom or the car or the dark of the bedroom when she was asleep and the ceiling was above him and the ceiling was the only thing looking back.

He could not be George. He could not make the voice. He could not fill the rooms with sound. He could not say *BABY GIRL* and have it mean what George meant. But he could hold. He could be warm and heavy and still and present and not leave.

The bear talked about honey. The man in the cardigan changed his shoes. The women cried and stopped crying and cried again. The curtains stayed drawn. The air stayed still. The Pacific stayed invisible.

A Tuesday. Late. The episode had ended and the screen was dark and the two women were asleep — Persefoni against his chest, Rosemary in the armchair with the afghan pulled up to her chin. The house was quiet. Not George's quiet — the other quiet, the one that had become the temperature of the rooms.

He sat on the couch that was too small for him and held the woman who was asleep against him and looked at the dark screen and the thought arrived the way his best throws arrived — before he could think it, already released, already in the air.

*Más que el juego.* More than the game.

Her and football. Her. Just her.

*Quédate.* Stay.

He stayed.

# Chapter 1.2 — The Drive (PROSE DRAFT)

Sergey was thinking about attention.

He'd been thinking about attention for most of the year — ever since he'd found the book in a used bookstore on Hawthorne, wedged between a water-stained copy of *Being and Nothingness* and someone's abandoned PhD thesis on Heidegger. *The Master and His Emissary.* Iain McGilchrist. The cover was plain, the subtitle was academic, and the first paragraph had rearranged something inside his skull that hadn't gone back to its original shape since.

The argument, stripped to its frame: the brain's two hemispheres didn't do what everyone thought they did. It wasn't left-for-logic, right-for-creativity — that was pop science, a bumper sticker version of something immeasurably more complex. What McGilchrist proposed was that the hemispheres offered two fundamentally different *modes of attention.* The right saw the whole — the gestalt, the living world in all its interconnected, never-fully-graspable totality. The left broke the whole into parts, labeled them, categorized them, made them useful. The right was the master. The left was its emissary — its envoy, its helper, its bureaucrat.

And the emissary had forgotten it was the emissary.

That was the part Sergey couldn't stop turning over. Not the neuroscience — he'd watched enough YouTube lectures to follow the fMRI data, the split-brain experiments, the lesion studies — but the *image.* The story McGilchrist had wrapped around the science. A master who sent a trusted servant to manage his lands. The servant, clever and efficient, began to believe he was the one in charge. Over time, the master's voice grew quieter. The servant's voice grew louder. And eventually the kingdom forgot there had ever been a real master at all.

It was, Sergey thought, the most important story he'd ever heard. And he'd spent the last six months trying to figure out how to tell it to other people without sounding like a textbook.

This was his problem. It was, if he was honest, the central problem of his life so far: the distance between what he understood and what he could make anyone else feel. He could explain the divided brain in technical terms — lateralization of function, the relationship between focal and broad attention, the phenomenological implications of right-hemisphere dominance in the apprehension of the lived world. He could be precise. He could be accurate. He could be completely, perfectly correct and put everyone in the room to sleep.

What he wanted — what he worked for, what he stayed up writing lyrics for until two in the morning, what he chased every time he picked up his guitar or sat down with a blank page — was to make someone feel what he felt when he read that book. Not understand it. *Feel* it. The way a song could make you feel something before you knew what it meant.

His band helped. Kind of. Freak folk, heavy on the lyrics, heavy on the storytelling. Songs that went sideways. Songs about things like a man who builds a house out of his own memories and then can't find the door, or a woman who teaches a river to speak and then can't make it stop talking. Sergey wrote all the lyrics and most of the melodies, and in the lyrics he could do the thing he couldn't do in conversation — he could take a philosophical concept and fold it into a story strange enough that the concept disappeared and only the feeling remained.

But he couldn't do it *talking.* Talking, the concepts came out first and the feeling came out never. He'd been working on the McGilchrist explanation for weeks. Trying different angles. The king and the servant was the best he'd come up with, but it still felt like a translation — something that gestured at the original without capturing it. He wanted the explanation to land the way the last verse of a good song lands, where you don't think *I understand* but rather *oh.* Just: *oh.*

He hadn't found it yet. But McGilchrist was speaking tomorrow, and Sergey was going to be in the room, and that was enough to make the two-hour drive to Hay-on-Wye feel like the drive to something that mattered.

---

George was driving. He drove the way he did everything — easily, with one hand on the wheel, the other gesturing along to whatever he was saying. The man was incapable of being in a space without filling it. Not loudly, not aggressively — George wasn't aggressive about anything. He just radiated, the way a campfire radiates. You came to him. You leaned in. He was warm and you wanted to be near the warmth.

Sergey loved George.

This was not a small thing and he didn't think about it casually. His own father, Dr. Viktor Volkov, was a research scientist at Intel — same campus as George, same company, different universe. Viktor worked in semiconductor process development. George was a technician on the fabrication floor. They'd met at a company picnic when Sergey was in middle school, and the friendship between the families had been immediate and lopsided in a way that Sergey found both comforting and painful to think about.

His parents loved him. He knew this the way he knew the periodic table — factually, abstractly, with confidence in the underlying data. They asked about his grades. They came to his school events when they remembered. They had given him a childhood full of books and silence and the implicit understanding that the life of the mind was the only life worth living. What they hadn't given him was the thing George gave everyone within a five-foot radius: the feeling that you were the most interesting person who had ever existed.

George asked Sergey how his day was. George asked follow-up questions. George remembered the answers and brought them up later, weeks later, like a man who kept a careful inventory of other people's lives because those lives mattered to him. When Sergey explained the bluestones at Stonehenge, George had leaned in and asked, "So they picked them for the sound? Like choosing an instrument?" and Sergey had felt, for a brief moment, seen in a way his own father had never made him feel.

It was possible, Sergey thought, that he was in love with Persephone's family more than he was in love with Kathleen.

He didn't let himself finish that thought. He put it in a drawer and closed the drawer and went back to thinking about attention.

---

Rosemary was in the passenger seat, scrolling through her photos from Stonehenge, which she'd been doing since they left the parking lot. Periodically she'd hold the phone up to George: "Look at this one!" George would glance over and say "Beautiful, baby" and Rosemary would beam and go back to scrolling. She'd taken maybe two hundred photos. She would post all of them.

The back seat was chaos.

Kathleen was in the middle. Persephone was behind Rosemary. Sergey was behind George. And Sheepey — the stuffed sheep they'd bought at Stonehenge, three inches tall, black wool, a face like a small ruined aristocrat — was propped between the two girls and currently being given a monologue.

"The thing about Tabitha," Persephone was saying, in the British accent that had been going for an hour now, "is that she never appreciated what she had. She had a man of distinction. A man of *Stone-henge.* And she threw it all away for a goat farmer."

"To be fair," Kathleen said, also British, "the goat farmer had land."

"Everyone has land in Devon, Kathleen. That's the whole problem with Devon."

"What's the problem with Devon?"

"Too much land. Not enough character. Sheepey had character."

"Sheepey lost three estates."

"He lost them with *dignity.*"

Sergey was smiling. He was always smiling when Persephone did this — the voice work, the character building, the way she could spin a world out of nothing and make you believe it was real while knowing it wasn't. It was, if he had to classify it — and he always had to classify it — a form of spontaneous mythopoesis. The creation of myth in real time. She didn't plan Sheepey's backstory. She didn't outline it. She opened her mouth and the story was there, fully formed, as if she'd simply remembered something that had always been true.

He had a word for what she was doing. Several words, actually. He could talk about narrative cognition, about the right hemisphere's capacity for implicit meaning-making, about the relationship between play and the generation of symbolic structures. He could be very precise about what Persephone was doing.

What he couldn't do was do it himself.

If Sergey tried to invent Sheepey, Sheepey would have a backstory that was architecturally sound and emotionally inert. Sheepey would have a coherent timeline and a thematic throughline and nobody would laugh. The structure would be there. The life wouldn't. He knew this about himself the way he knew most uncomfortable things — clearly, technically, with full awareness of the gap between diagnosis and cure.

Persephone caught him watching her. She did this sometimes — looked up mid-bit, mid-laugh, and caught his eyes on her, and something would flicker across her face that he couldn't classify. Not discomfort. Not pleasure. Something like recognition — a brief acknowledgment that he was seeing something she wasn't performing.

"What?" she said.

"Nothing."

"You always say nothing. You're always staring at me and saying nothing."

"I'm not staring. I'm sitting in a car. There are limited viewing options."

"He's writing a song about you," Kathleen said, squeezing his hand. "It's called 'The Girl Who Wouldn't Shut Up About Sheep.'"

"That's actually a great title," Persephone said. "You should use that. I want a writing credit."

Sergey laughed. Kathleen laughed. And the moment passed, the way these moments always passed — lightly, quickly, without anyone acknowledging the thing underneath. Kathleen's hand was warm in his. Persephone's eyes were already somewhere else, back on Sheepey, back in the game, and Sergey was back in the drawer where he kept the thoughts he wouldn't finish.

The English countryside was doing that thing the English countryside does — being so green it looked fake, like someone had adjusted the saturation and forgotten to stop. Stone walls divided the fields into irregular patches. Sheep dotted the hillsides like the ones at Stonehenge, unbothered, unimpressed by the beauty they were standing in the middle of. Sergey watched them through the window and thought about the relationship between an organism and its environment — how the sheep had no aesthetic experience of the landscape, no concept of its own beauty within it, no narrative about itself at all. It just was. Present. Attending to the grass.

That was the Master. That was what McGilchrist was talking about. The mode of attention that precedes classification. Before the word *sheep*, before the word *green*, before any label at all — there's just the seeing. The raw encounter with the thing itself.

He was going to try to explain this to Persephone later and she was going to get bored.

He already knew this. She'd get bored because he'd explain it the way he always explained things — carefully, precisely, with too many qualifications and not enough images. He'd lose her in the second sentence. She'd start looking around the room. And the thing he wanted her to feel — the staggering implications of what McGilchrist was proposing, the idea that an entire civilization had organized itself around the wrong half of its brain — would evaporate before it reached her.

Unless he could find the image. The one that would make her go *oh.*

He'd been working on it. The king and the servant. The master sending the emissary to manage the lands. The emissary forgetting, growing certain, locking the master away. He'd written it out three different ways in his notebook. The first version was too technical. The second was too long. The third was close — close enough that he could feel the shape of it, the way you can feel a word on the tip of your tongue — but it wasn't there yet.

Tomorrow. McGilchrist was speaking tomorrow. And maybe hearing it from the source would give him what he needed — not the argument but the *feeling* of the argument, the thing that lived under the words, the thing that made the book feel less like an academic treatise and more like a warning. An ancient story about something happening right now, to everyone, all the time, and nobody could see it because the thing preventing them from seeing it was the same thing they were using to look.

The servant was running the kingdom. And everyone thought the servant was the king.

"We're getting close!" George announced from the front seat, and Rosemary immediately started taking photos of the road.

"George, that's just a field."

"It's a Welsh field, baby. That's different."

"How is it different?"

"It's got more character. Like Sheepey."

"Oh my God, Dad," Persephone said. "Don't encourage him."

"Sheepey is Welsh?" Kathleen said.

"Sheepey is from Stone-*henge*," Persephone corrected, British accent back at full power. "Which is in *Wiltshire.* Very different from Wales. The Welsh wouldn't have him. He owes money in Cardiff."

"How much?"

"An ungentlemanly amount."

Hay-on-Wye appeared around a bend — the town built into the hillside, the castle visible above the rooftops, the festival tents spread across the fields below. Sergey felt something in his chest he could identify precisely — anticipatory arousal, elevated heart rate, a release of dopamine in response to proximity to a desired stimulus — and also something he couldn't identify at all, which was just: he was fifteen years old and the man who had rearranged his brain was somewhere in that town, and tomorrow he was going to hear him speak, and that mattered in a way that didn't fit inside any classification system he had.

"Are those yurts?" Kathleen said, pressing her face to the window.

They were yurts. Two of them, set apart from the main festival grounds, white canvas with round wooden doors. George had booked them — one for the adults, one for the kids. Because of course George had. George handled everything.

"I call the one on the left," Persephone said.

"They're the same," Sergey said.

"The one on the left has better energy."

"That's not — that doesn't — " He stopped. She was grinning at him. She knew exactly what she was doing. She was poking the part of him that needed to classify everything, and she found it funny, and he found it funny that she found it funny, and for a moment the drawer opened and the thought he kept inside it was very close to the surface.

He closed it.

"Fine," he said. "The one on the left."

George parked the car. Everyone piled out. Rosemary was already taking photos of the yurts. George was already talking to someone — a festival volunteer, a stranger, it didn't matter, George would be friends with them in thirty seconds. Kathleen was stretching her legs, looking at the castle on the hill. And Persephone was holding Sheepey up to the yurt door, doing his voice:

"I say. Rather rustic, isn't it? I had a yurt once. Lost it in a card game in Bruges."

Sergey stood by the car and watched her and thought: *spontaneous mythopoesis.* And then he thought: *she makes things real just by saying them.*

Better. Still not right.

He got his bag from the trunk and followed his girlfriend toward the yurt on the left.

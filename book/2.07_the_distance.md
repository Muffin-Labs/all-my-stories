Four years. The field, the lights, the Sundays. The smell of the box — leather seats, cold air conditioning, the faint sweetness of someone's perfume mixing with the popcorn from the level below. The sound of sixty thousand people becoming one sound. Four years of the machine running, the wins blurring into parades and the losses blurring into next-years and the whole golden, enormous, impossible thing becoming the texture of her life.

They won in 2023. The confetti was red and pewter and it fell like weather and she was in the box with Ashli and Kelli and her dad was screaming at a volume the stadium could not contain and the three women were holding each other and crying and laughing and the confetti was in her hair and she thought: *this is what it feels like.* Not as a statement. As a temperature.

They won again in 2024. The second one was different — not less, but different. Champa Bay was the name now, the city rewritten around the fact of Démion Reyes, banners on every skyline. Her dad was at the parade, shirtless, on someone's shoulders — a sixty-year-old man, six-four, two hundred and forty pounds, on the shoulders of a stranger who was also shirtless and also screaming, and Persefoni had watched from the float and laughed until her ribs ached.

They lost in 2025. They lost again in 2026. Other teams had adjusted. Other quarterbacks had studied him. Démion was still Démion — the numbers obscene, the highlights surreal, the body doing things that should have been retired to mythology — but the math had shifted. One man against a league that had spent four years learning to be afraid of him and had finally learned to use the fear.

She didn't track the shift. She tracked other things.

The brand. Millions of followers on Instagram, millions more across platforms she'd stopped counting. Brand partnerships arriving in her inbox every week — predictable, enormous, constant. La had built a team around the team: assistants, accountants, lawyers. The money had stopped surprising her. There was just the magnitude.

Sheepey. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge who'd been born on a road trip to a philosophy festival named after a line of poetry — two girls in the back seat, a gift shop, a stuffed animal that became a person because they decided he was one. The comedy was theirs and nobody else's. Sheepey was a Netflix show now. Two seasons in, produced in LA, the kind of phenomenon that defied every metric the industry used to measure success — a children's show that adults watched with the devotion of a congregation. It was Bluey. It was the thing Bluey was: made for kids, devoured by parents, the kind of show where a thirty-year-old man watched one episode and immediately ordered the plush. The Sheepey plush was everywhere. She saw him in airports. She saw him in strollers. She saw the sheep she'd given a gambling problem and a Stonehenge membership card and a history of unfortunate investments in Victorian horse breeding on the shelves of children who had never heard of Persefoni Minton and didn't need to because Sheepey had outgrown his creator the way rivers outgrow their source.

She didn't think about Kathleen when she saw the plush. She didn't think about the bedroom or the phone or the cross-legged girl with the big doe eyes who had been the first audience. Sheepey belonged to the world now. The world didn't know about the bedroom.

Her dad in Gulfport. Fifteen minutes away. The phone calls after every game — every game, every Sunday, the deep warm voice arriving in her ear before the shower was cold: "BABY GIRL. DID YOU SEE THAT. DID YOU SEE YOUR MAN." He never waited for her to call. He called her. The reaching was the thing — not the conversation that followed, not the analysis. Just the reaching.

Her mom in the bungalow. The curtains. The guest room always ready. The candle on the nightstand that smelled like vanilla, replaced before it burned out — the invisible labor of making someone else's choices livable. Her mom at the door every time Persefoni came over, the door already open before she knocked, as if she could hear the car from inside the kitchen. Maybe she could. Maybe the listening was that precise. "There she is," her mom would say. The same words every time.

The trio. Still intact. Still real. Ashli and Kelli and Persefoni — the triangle that had formed at the Wine House over backsplash jokes and never stopped forming. Thursday dinners when the schedule allowed. Saturday brunches when the schedule allowed. The group text that never slept — Kelli sending listings of absurd houses with captions that made Persefoni spit out her coffee, Ashli responding twelve hours later with one sentence that was funnier than everything that preceded it, the rhythm of three women who had found the thing they were together and kept finding it. The trio held. The dropped pass was in the room — always in the room, the way weather is in the room, present even when nobody mentions it — but the room was bigger than the pass. The room had been bigger since the Wine House.

Four years of golden. The life she'd built at eighteen had become the life she lived at twenty-three, and the becoming was so smooth she couldn't have told you when the building stopped and the living started.

She didn't notice other things.

His schedule. Sunday was his day. Tuesday was their day. Wednesday through Saturday was preparation, which meant Wednesday through Saturday was hers — her freedom shaped by his absence, her independence carved from the negative space of his career. She didn't see it. It was everywhere, constant, the air she breathed.

She adapted. Her brand operated around his schedule. Her visits to the Gulfport bungalow happened on days the schedule allowed. Her dinners with the trio were organized around Sundays and Tuesdays and a week that belonged to a game she didn't play. She'd been doing this for four years. The four years had been golden. The trap was lined with love.

March 2026. He left.

Not her — Tampa. He left Tampa. Free agency, the annual reshuffling of the NFL's geography. He signed with the Los Angeles Chargers. The reasons were football reasons: Ladd McConkey, the young receiver who ran routes like a mind reader. Jim Harbaugh, the coach whose instinct matched Démion's — preparation wrapped around the same jazz. The Chargers were building something. Tampa had given him five seasons, two rings, and a city that worshipped him. LA offered the biggest market. The brightest lights.

He didn't deliberate. He was in LA before March was over. New house, new facility, new teammates.

She watched him go. She'd seen him make decisions before — the frictionless certainty of a man who had never confused thinking with doing. He did. The doing was immediate. She loved this about him. Or she'd decided she loved it — the decision so old she couldn't tell it apart from the feeling.

He was in LA. She was in St. Pete.

---

The long distance was supposed to be hard.

It wasn't.

She noticed this through her body, not her mind. She moved differently without him. The condo was the same condo — the twenty-third floor, the bay flat and blue through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the space that had been hers since she was eighteen. But the space felt different. Not emptier. Roomier. She could feel it in the mornings, the bed wider, the coffee slower, the quiet a thing she chose instead of a thing that was left over.

The NFL schedule was gone. Not football — Démion still played, the Chargers' season starting in September, the games happening on the screens in the suite she no longer sat in. But the *schedule* was gone — the organizing principle, the weekly architecture that had shaped her life for four years. Sunday wasn't his day anymore. Tuesday wasn't their day. Wednesday through Saturday wasn't preparation. Every day was just a day, unstructured by someone else's career, and the unstructuring was — spacious. There was no other word. She had room. She had room she hadn't known she didn't have until the room appeared.

She visited her parents in Gulfport on a Tuesday morning because Tuesday mornings were hers now. She showed up at the bungalow unannounced and her dad was on the porch with coffee and the physical newspaper — the actual paper, because George Minton believed in paper the way he believed in Alabama football. He saw her and his face did the thing and his arms went wide and the coffee sloshed and the hug was total, immediate, a man experiencing reunion as a physical event.

"Baby girl! On a TUESDAY!"

She sat on the porch with him and they talked about nothing — the Gulf, the neighbors, the guy three houses down who was building a deck and building it wrong. Her dad's voice carrying across the yard, low and warm, narrating the construction failures with the gravity of a man describing a war. Her mom brought out a second coffee without being asked. The lemon tree moved in the wind off the Gulf.

She went back the next Tuesday morning. And the one after that. The Tuesday visits became her thing — no schedule preventing it, the fifteen-minute drive to Gulfport the simplest joy available to her. Her dad on the porch. Her mom in the kitchen. The bungalow warm and small and exactly itself.

She saw Ashli on a Monday. She saw Kelli for drinks on a Wednesday night. She sat on the floor of Ashli's living room with Ariah and Amari and did the Sheepey voice — the drunk dignified sheep explaining to two small children why Mondays were a conspiracy invented by Romans who hadn't slept well — and the kids lost their minds and Ashli watched from the kitchen island with her quiet attention, the look of a woman who saw.

She was in her own life. Not because Démion had taken it — he hadn't — but because the gravity of his schedule had been so constant she'd forgotten what her weeks felt like without it. Now she remembered.

She told herself she missed him. She did miss him. She missed the body next to her in the morning, the size of him, his arm finding her hip in the dark without waking up. She missed the smell — skin, soap, the underneath thing that was just him. She missed the Tuesday dinners where his leg pressed against hers under the table, a language below the conversation.

But underneath the missing, in the space the missing didn't fill, there was something she couldn't name. Something quieter than happiness. She just drove to Gulfport on Tuesday mornings without checking anyone's schedule.

---

She decided to move.

Not immediately — it took a few months. Spring into summer. The decision built itself inside her without her permission, the body arriving at a destination the mind hadn't mapped.

The logic was clean. They were getting married in two years. Long distance didn't work forever. His career was a ten-year window that didn't bend — the NFL didn't relocate to St. Pete because a quarterback's girlfriend liked the bay. Her brand could operate from anywhere. Her phone worked in LA. Sheepey didn't have a zip code. The Netflix production was already in LA. The meetings were in LA. The entertainment industry, the content industry, the fame industry — everything she did as an influencer and brand was headquartered in the city her man had just moved to. Moving to LA wasn't just following Démion. It was stepping into the center of her own professional world.

All of this was true.

She recognized this and didn't linger on the irony — the professional justification wrapping the personal decision. The brand *could* operate from anywhere. But it operated better from here. The sentence was true, and the truth gave her permission, and the permission was what she needed because the real reason — *he's there and I should be where he is* — was a sentence she couldn't say without hearing her mother's voice inside it.

Démion said *LA* and Persefoni said *it makes sense.* She said *the timing is right.* She said everything except the thing that was true, which was that the man she loved was 2,500 miles away and the distance was more than she could hold.

Her dad followed her to Florida. Her mom followed her dad. Now Persefoni followed Démion.

---

She bought her own place. Santa Monica. Cash. Her name. Not Démion's house — her own house.

She'd been doing this since she was eighteen: buying her own space, maintaining her own address, keeping the gap between her life and his. The condo in St. Pete was across the bay from Tampa — thirty minutes of water, thirty minutes of independence. The Santa Monica place was across the city from Démion's house in Bel Air. Thirty minutes. The same distance. The same bay of independence she'd been maintaining since she was eighteen, transplanted to a different coast.

Kelli wasn't her realtor this time — different market, different state. She missed Kelli during the process, missed the comedy that made the paperwork bearable. The new realtor was competent and professional and not funny.

But the instinct was the same. Cash purchase. Her money. Her name. Her space. The one thread she never let go of, even as every other thread wrapped around him.

The Santa Monica place was smaller than the St. Pete condo — a two-bedroom near the bluffs, windows everywhere, the Pacific visible from the living room. Different water. Same distance. She stood in the living room on the day she got the keys and the salt air came through the open windows and she could hear the waves below the bluff and she thought of nothing in particular. This was hers.

---

She told her parents in August.

She drove to Gulfport on a Tuesday morning — the Tuesday visit, the ritual that had become the best part of her week, the fifteen minutes of Florida road that ended at the porch where her father sat with coffee and the paper and the running commentary on the neighbor's deck, which was still being built and was still being built wrong. She sat on the porch. Her mom brought coffee. The lemon tree moved in the wind.

"I'm moving to LA."

Her dad didn't blink. His face went immediately and totally to the place it went when he'd decided something was good — the brightness, the widening, the grin arriving before the words.

"Go," he said. "Go be with your man. We're not going anywhere."

The generosity was total and immediate. The leaving felt like his idea, his gift, his blessing — as if the permission was what made it possible.

She wanted to say: *I don't want to go.* She wanted to say: *I'm twenty-three and I've been fifteen minutes from you for four years and the fifteen minutes has been the architecture of my happiness and I'm about to give it up for a man whose career doesn't bend.* She wanted to say: *tell me not to go.*

She didn't say any of this. She said: "You'll come visit. The guest room's going to be ready before I've unpacked."

"BABY GIRL. You couldn't keep us away. Baby, pack a bag."

Her mom looked up from the kitchen — the window above the sink, her face framed by the curtains she'd chosen, the Florida light softened through them. "We'll be right here," her mom said. Quiet. Certain. Something in it Persefoni could hear but not name.

She flew to LA in September.

---

The city was a machine.

Not a metaphor — a machine. Tampa was a football town and St. Pete was a beach town and both of them were warm and human-scaled. LA was something else. The freeways hummed at a frequency she could feel through the car seat. The billboards were forty feet tall. The air smelled like exhaust and jasmine and money. The restaurants had wait lists and the wait lists had wait lists and the whole city operated on a currency of access that pretended to be indifferent to fame.

She was famous here in a way she hadn't been famous in Tampa. In Tampa she was Démion's girlfriend — the most beautiful woman in the box, the influencer with the following, the girl the city had absorbed into the football narrative. In LA she was Persefoni Minton — the brand, the following, the Netflix show, the woman whose sheep was on the side of a bus on Sunset Boulevard. The Netflix Sheepey billboards were everywhere. She saw Sheepey on buildings. She saw the sheep she'd invented with Kathleen in a gift shop at Stonehenge on the side of a studio lot, forty feet tall, the plush dignified face staring down at traffic with the expression of a sheep who had seen better roads.

The meetings started immediately. La had structured the first month like a campaign — studio meetings, brand partnerships, the Netflix production team, the agents and managers and entertainment lawyers who materialized around her. La in LA was La at full power. The cousin-manager who had been running a brand from St. Pete was now at the center of the industry, and the city fit her like a thing she'd been waiting for.

Persefoni moved through it. The meetings, the studios, the dinners. She was good at this — she had always been good at this, the rooms relaxing around her, the people leaning in. She could feel them deciding she was easy. She wasn't easy. She was practiced.

It wasn't ease. She missed the porch.

She missed the Tuesday mornings. She missed the fifteen-minute drive and the coffee on the porch and her dad's voice narrating the neighbor's deck and her mom's face in the kitchen window. She missed Ashli's living room and Ariah's questions and Amari's conviction that the proper response to any statement was to throw something. She missed Kelli's texts — the one-line texts that arrived at random hours and were funnier than anything she'd say to a hundred million followers.

The trio operated long-distance now. The group text was the same — Kelli's listings, Ashli's delayed responses, the rhythm unchanged. But the voice memos were different. The FaceTime calls were different. You couldn't save a seat for someone who was 2,500 miles away. The trio was real but it was remote, and remote was a different thing.

She called her dad every Sunday. Not after games anymore — the time zones were wrong, the rhythm disrupted by the geography. But she called. Sundays were still Sundays, and the "BABY GIRL" that hit her ear every week was the same word in the same register at the same volume. She held onto that.

"How's the weather?" her mom asked. Tuesdays.

"It's LA, Mom. It's always perfect."

"Perfect." The word arriving in her mom's mouth with a warmth that was genuine and also something else — a flicker, a ghost, the word *perfect* carrying more weight than the weather deserved. Her mom in the bungalow in Gulfport, in the kitchen, the curtains drawn exactly right, the guest room ready, the house holding the shape of a family that had been rearranged.

"You should come visit," Persefoni said. "Both of you. Come see the place."

"Your father's already planning it. He's got the whole trip mapped out."

"Mapped out."

"He wants to drive."

"Mom. It's a thirty-hour drive."

"He wants to see the country. He says he's never driven across the country and he's not dying without driving across the country."

"He's not dying."

"I told him the same thing. He said 'Rosemary, a man needs to see the land.'"

She could hear her father in the background — the deep voice, the words indistinct, the cadence unmistakable. He was narrating something. He was always narrating something.

"November," her mom said. "For your birthday. He wants to be there for your birthday."

"Tell him to fly."

"I've told him to fly. He says flying is for people who are in a hurry."

She laughed. The refusing to fly was so completely, so immovably George that for the duration of the laugh the distance collapsed and she was on the porch again. Tuesday morning. The coffee warm. The lemon tree moving in the wind.

"November," she said. "Tell him I'll have the guest room ready."

---

November came.

The Santa Monica place was ready — the guest room made up, the sheets new, a candle on the nightstand because her mother always put a candle on the nightstand and Persefoni had inherited the gesture without deciding to. She'd stocked the kitchen. She'd put Alabama football magnets on the refrigerator — a joke, a gift, a thing her dad would see and love. She'd cleaned the bathroom twice because her mom would notice if she'd only cleaned it once.

Her parents were driving. Her dad had won the argument — of course he had. They were driving from Gulfport to Los Angeles, the southern route, the Gulf Coast to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to California. They were stopping at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama on the way — the first stop, just across the Florida border. Her dad's brother. Her dad's hometown.

Her birthday was November 7th. They'd planned to arrive the 6th — a day early, because her dad believed in arriving early the way he believed in Alabama football and physical newspapers. The day before the birthday was the day you showed up.

She tracked their progress through text messages. Her mom texted from the passenger seat — brief, sweet, punctuated with periods because her mom treated text messages like letters.

*Left Gulfport this morning. Your father is singing.*

*Stopped for gas in Pensacola. Your father spoke to the gas station attendant for twenty minutes.*

*Heading to Uncle Ray's. Should be there by dinner.*

*Your father says to tell you he loves you and also Roll Tide.*

She smiled at the phone. She was in the Santa Monica living room, the Pacific flat and silver through the windows, the evening light doing the thing LA light did in November — turning everything amber, gilding the surfaces, the whole city performing its beauty for anyone who looked. She could see the ocean from the couch. She could hear the traffic on PCH below, the ambient hum of a city that never stopped moving. She was twenty-three years old. Her parents were driving to see her. Her birthday was in five days. The guest room smelled like vanilla.

The phone rang at 7:47 PM.

La's ringtone. Not her mom, not her dad. La.

"Persefoni."

La's voice was wrong. La's voice was never wrong — La's voice was the most controlled instrument Persefoni knew, every syllable managed, every crisis a problem to be solved. This voice was not that voice.

"La. What's wrong?"

"Listen to me. Your dad — your dad had a heart attack."

"What?"

"He's at the hospital. In Alabama. Aunt Beth just called me. He's alive, Persefoni. He's alive."

"What do you mean he had a heart attack? He's — they just left this morning, they were just — La, what do you mean?"

"I'm booking you a flight. Pensacola — it's the closest airport. I'll meet you there. I'm already booked out of Orlando."

"Is he okay? La. Is he okay?"

"The hospital — it's small, Persefoni. It's rural. I'm going to make sure they—"

"Is he going to be okay?"

La paused. La never paused.

"He's alive. They're working on him. I'll know more when I get there."

"I need to — I need to go. I need to get there. How do I —"

"I'll text you the flight. Pack now. Go to the airport. I'll be there when you land."

"I need to — I need to go. I need to get there. How do I —"

"I know. I'm booking it right now. I need you to pack a bag. Can you do that?"

She was standing in the living room and she didn't remember standing and her hands were shaking. The room was wrong. The room was the same room she'd been sitting in thirty seconds ago and nothing in it made sense — the couch, the ocean, the candle burning in the guest room for a man who was in a hospital in Alabama. She couldn't think. She couldn't make her hands do anything.

"I don't — La, what do I pack?"

"Clothes. Toothbrush. Charger. That's it. I'll get you everything else."

She went to the bedroom. She opened a suitcase. She put a shirt in it and stood there looking at the shirt.

"La. He was fine. He was just — Mom texted me two hours ago. He was singing in the car. He was *singing.*"

"I know. I know he was. Put pants in the bag, Persefoni."

She put pants in the bag. She picked up the candle from the guest room — the vanilla candle, the one she'd bought for her mother — and put it in the suitcase. She didn't know why. She couldn't find her shoes. They were by the door where they always were and she couldn't find them and La said "by the front door" and there they were.

"I'm sending you the flight confirmation now. LAX to Pensacola, red-eye, you board in two hours. Can you drive?"

"I can drive."

"Are you sure? I can call a car."

"I can drive."

She drove to LAX and couldn't remember the drive. La stayed on the phone the entire way — not talking, not always, but there, the line open, the sound of La breathing and typing and booking and managing audible through the speaker while Persefoni drove with her hands shaking on the wheel. She parked in a garage and couldn't remember the level. She walked through the terminal with the suitcase and the candle and no underwear and La's voice in her ear saying *gate 34, you're in 2A, they're boarding now, go.*

---

Four and a half hours. The flight was four and a half hours and she couldn't do anything for four and a half hours. She couldn't get off the plane. She couldn't make it go faster. She was in a metal tube at 35,000 feet and her father was in a hospital and there was nothing she could do except sit in seat 2A and hold her phone and wait.

She bought the wifi before the wheels left the ground. Her hands were still shaking. She typed La's name wrong twice before the message went through.

Persefoni: *is he okay? whats happening? la please*

Persefoni: *are you there*

La: *I'm here. I just landed. Rental car, driving to the hospital now. Uncle Ray called 911 from the house. Ambulance came fast. He's at the ER. Small hospital — rural, closest one. I'm twenty minutes out.*

Persefoni: *is he going to be okay*

La: *He's alive. They're working on him. I'll know more when I get there.*

Persefoni: *what about mom? is mom okay? where is mom?*

La: *She's at the hospital. Ray drove her. She's in the waiting room.*

Persefoni: *la I can't do this. I can't sit here. I can't sit here for four hours while my dad is*

La: *I know. I'm going to be there in fifteen minutes. I'll text you everything as soon as I know. Try to breathe.*

She couldn't breathe. She was breathing but the breathing wasn't working — the air going in and out and doing nothing, the phone in her hand not saying anything.

La: *Aunt Beth is getting updates from Ray. They're running tests.*

The typing indicator appeared and disappeared. Appeared and disappeared. Three dots. No dots. Three dots.

La: *It's not good. They misdiagnosed him. Treated him for the wrong thing for the first hour. They've corrected but the window — the first hour matters with cardiac and they lost it.*

Persefoni: *what does that mean*

Persefoni: *la what does that mean*

Persefoni: *are you saying he's going to die*

La: *I'm going to fix this. I'm calling ahead. There's a specialist in Mobile.*

She read the message and read it again and the words didn't make sense. Misdiagnosed. Wrong thing. First hour. The words were medical words and the medical words were about her father and her father was the man who had been singing in the car six hours ago. Her mother had texted her. *Your father is singing.* He was singing and now the first hour was lost and La was calling a specialist in Mobile and none of this was real. None of this was happening. She was going to wake up. She was going to look at her phone and the messages would be gone and her dad would be at Uncle Ray's house eating dinner and her mom would text: *Your father ate too much.*

She pressed the call button by accident. The flight attendant came. "Are you all right?" She wasn't all right. She said she was fine. The flight attendant brought water. She held the water and didn't drink it.

La: *I'm at the hospital. It's twenty beds and two doctors. The specialist is coming from Mobile — two hours. I'm making sure they don't do anything else wrong in the meantime.*

Persefoni: *is he going to make it? la is my dad going to make it?*

La: *He's in surgery now. The specialist is good. The specialist is the right person.*

Persefoni: *tell me he's going to be okay*

La: *The specialist is the right person. I'm here. I'm making sure they do everything right.*

She closed her eyes and saw her father's hands. The coffee mug on the porch in Gulfport, small in his grip. The grip of a man who held everything gently because his hands were big enough that gentleness was the only option. His hands on her shoulders at the airport when she was eighteen. His hands lifting her off the ground in the terminal, every time, every —

The phone buzzed.

La: *Persefoni I need to tell you something else. Your mom collapsed in the waiting room. They're working on her now. Her heart — they're saying stress cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo. They're admitting her.*

She read the message twice. She read it three times. The words wouldn't arrange themselves into something she could understand. Her mom. Her mom collapsed. Her mom was — what? Her mom was in the waiting room. Her mom was supposed to be in the waiting room waiting for her dad to come out of surgery. Her mom was supposed to be sitting in a chair. Her mom was not supposed to be a second emergency. Her mom was not supposed to need a doctor. Her mom was supposed to — her mom was supposed to be the *mom.* Her mom was supposed to hold it together long enough for her father to get out of surgery and for Persefoni to land and for someone — anyone — to tell her it was going to be okay. That was the job. That was the one thing. Hold it together. Sit in the chair. Wait.

She couldn't even do that.

The thought arrived and the thought was ugly and the ugliness made her sick because her mother was in a hospital bed and the first thing Persefoni felt was not fear — it was anger. Anger at her mother for collapsing. Anger at her mother for making this worse. Anger at her mother for being so completely, so totally built around her father that her body couldn't survive a waiting room without him, that her heart — her actual, physical heart — couldn't hold the possibility of his absence long enough for the doctors to do their work. Her mother's body had given up before the surgery was over. Her mother had quit before anyone knew if there was something to quit about.

And then the guilt — immediate, scalding, the guilt of a daughter who just thought that about her mother while her mother was being admitted to the same hospital as her father, and the guilt didn't cancel the anger and the anger didn't cancel the guilt and both of them lived in her chest alongside the terror that she was going to lose both of them and she was at 35,000 feet over the desert and she couldn't do anything about any of it.

Persefoni: *is she okay? la is she going to be okay?*

La: *She's alive. They're working on her. I'm here. I'm handling both.*

Both. Both of her parents were in a hospital and the hospital was twenty beds and two doctors and she was in a plane and she couldn't get off the plane and everyone on this plane was asleep and her parents were dying in a building she couldn't get to and her mother had collapsed because her mother couldn't survive a waiting room and her father was in surgery because his heart had failed and her mother's heart was failing because his heart had failed and the two of them were a single system, had always been a single system, and the system was crashing and she was in the sky.

The wifi dropped over Arizona. The screen went blank — no signal, no bars, no messages, nothing. She refreshed. Nothing. She turned the wifi off and on. Nothing. She pressed every button on the screen. Nothing. Twenty minutes of staring at a phone that showed the last message — *I'm handling both* — and wouldn't show the next one, and the not-showing was the worst thing, worse than the messages, because the messages were terrible but the messages were information and the nothing was a door slammed shut between her and the only person who knew if her parents were alive.

She was crying. She didn't know when she'd started. The flight attendant came back. "Ma'am?" She shook her head. The flight attendant left. She pressed her face into the window and the window was cold and the cold was the only real thing.

When the wifi reconnected:

La: *Your mom is bad. They're fighting to stabilize her. She keeps trying to get out of the bed. She keeps asking where he is. They had to sedate her. They're saying if they can't get her heart rate down in the next hour they're talking about intervention.*

La: *Your dad is still in surgery. I'm here. I'm handling both. I'll be at the airport when you land. Walk straight out, I'll be at arrivals.*

Persefoni: *are they going to die? la are both my parents going to die?*

La: *No. I'm here. I'm not going to let that happen. Get off the plane when it lands and walk straight to me.*

The plane descended. She didn't look out the window. She stared at her phone. She'd been staring at it for four and a half hours. The cup of water she'd never drunk was still in the seat pocket.

She walked off the plane and La was there. La took the bag out of her hand and grabbed her arm and started walking and Persefoni let herself be walked because walking was not something she could do on her own right now. Her legs were doing the thing legs do but the legs were not connected to anything — not to her brain, not to the terminal, not to the Florida morning coming through the airport windows. She was a body being moved through a building by a woman who knew where to go.

"La — my dad. Is he okay? Is he out of surgery?"

"He's still in surgery. The specialist is good. He's the right person." La was walking fast, pulling her through the terminal toward the parking garage. "But the first hour, Persefoni. The first hour they lost. He was big, he was in distress, and they went the wrong direction. By the time they corrected—"

"Take me to him. Take me there."

"He's in Alabama. Three hours."

"I don't care. Take me to him. I want to be there when he comes out."

"Persefoni." La stopped walking. In the middle of the terminal, with people flowing around them, La stopped and turned and looked at her and Persefoni saw La's face for the first time since she'd landed — the jaw set, the eyes red, the face of a woman who had not slept and had been fighting and was still fighting. "Your mom is being airlifted to Pensacola right now. Sacred Heart. She's landing in forty minutes. They're fighting to keep her alive. They had to sedate her. They can't get her heart rate down. She needs you."

"My dad needs me."

"Your dad is in surgery and the surgeon is the right person and there is nothing you can do in Alabama except sit in a waiting room. Your mom is *here.* Your mom needs you *here.*"

"She collapsed, La." Her voice came out wrong — not broken, not grief. Hard. "She's sitting in a waiting room and she *collapsed.* She couldn't — she couldn't hold on? Dad is the one in surgery. Dad is the one who's — and she couldn't sit in a *chair?* What am I supposed to do about that? What am I supposed to do about *her?*"

She heard the words come out and they were ugly and she didn't take them back. Her mother was in a helicopter and her mother might die and the first thing Persefoni felt when she thought about her mother was not fear. It was anger. And the anger made her sick because the anger meant she was a person who could be angry at her dying mother and what kind of person — what kind of daughter —

"I know," La said. Quiet. Steady. Not judging. "I know. Come on. The car is this way."

La drove. Persefoni sat in the passenger seat and her hands were shaking and the shaking hadn't stopped since the phone rang in Santa Monica and she didn't know if the shaking was ever going to stop. The streets were unfamiliar. Everything was unfamiliar — the light, the buildings, the city she was born in and didn't recognize, the morning that was happening around her as if mornings still happened, as if the sun still came up, as if the world hadn't ended in a text message over New Mexico.

Her phone rang. La's phone, in the cupholder, buzzed at the same time. Both phones. Both phones at once.

La answered. Listened. Her face changed and the change was small and the small was the worst thing Persefoni had ever seen.

She hung up.

"He's gone," La said. "Persefoni. He's gone. He died in surgery. Twenty minutes ago."

"No."

"Persefoni—"

"No. No, he's in surgery. You said the specialist was the right person. You said—"

"He died twenty minutes ago. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Persefoni."

"No. Drive to Alabama. La, drive to Alabama. Take me to him. I need to — take me to him."

"Persefoni."

"TAKE ME TO HIM."

La didn't turn the car. She kept driving toward Sacred Heart. Her face was wet and she was crying without making a sound and she didn't turn the car.

"Persefoni. Your mom is landing in fifteen minutes. We need to be at Sacred Heart. I need you to hear me."

She heard her father's voice. *BABY GIRL.* The voice was in the car and it wasn't in the car and she was never going to hear it again. She was going to call him and he wasn't going to answer. She was going to drive to Gulfport and the porch — the porch —

"Persefoni. Your mom."

Her mom. Her mom was in a helicopter. Her mom was — her dad was dead and her mom was in a helicopter and La was driving and Persefoni was in the passenger seat and none of this was real. None of this was happening. Her dad was dead. Her dad was dead and her mom was dying and she was in a car.

She couldn't stop saying *no.* Quietly, under her breath. No. No. No.

La had already handled it. By the time they reached the hospital, La had fought the rural Alabama ER into transferring Rosemary to Pensacola. She'd argued with administrators. Fought with insurance. Managed her father's body in Alabama and her mother's transfer to Sacred Heart and the logistics of death and the logistics of a second emergency and she'd done all of it while Persefoni sat in the car saying *no.*

Persefoni walked into the hospital and La pointed her toward the room and she went. She didn't know where she was going. She followed the hallway and the room number and she went in.

Her mother was in a bed. Small, connected to machines, the blonde hair against the pillow damp with sweat. The doctors had sedated her twice. The nurses had restrained her once — soft restraints on her wrists because she kept pulling out her IV, kept trying to get up, kept asking *where is he, where is George, I need to see George.* The monitors beeped. The numbers on the screens were bad. She didn't know what the numbers meant but she could tell they were bad.

The room smelled like antiseptic and plastic. She stood in the doorway and her mother was in the bed and her father was dead and she didn't know what to do. She didn't know what she was supposed to do.

"Mom."

Her mother's eyes were open. Barely. The sedation had softened everything — her face, her hands, the panic that La had described in the texts. The panic was gone and what was left was worse. A stillness. Her mother looked like she was practicing.

"Mom. I'm here."

Her mother's eyes found her. Slowly. The eyes found her face and something flickered — recognition, life, the first thing that looked like life since Persefoni had walked into this room.

"Baby." Barely audible above the machines.

Persefoni sat in the chair and took her mother's hand. The hand was small and cold. She held it and heard herself say something she hadn't planned to say — something that came out in a voice she didn't recognize, a voice that sounded like her father's voice.

"It's going to be okay, Mom. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."

She didn't know if it was going to be okay. She didn't know anything. Her father was dead and she was holding her mother's hand and saying the things her father would have said and her mother was looking at her like Persefoni was the only thing keeping her in the world. And she was. She was the only thing. Because the person who had always been that thing was dead.

She was twenty-three years old. Her father was dead. And her mother needed her — needed her so completely that there was no room for Persefoni to need anything. Her mother needed someone to hold onto. Her mother needed George. And George was gone so Persefoni was George now. She held the hand. She said the words. She sealed her own grief behind something — she didn't know what, a wall, a door, something — and she became the person in the room who was okay, because someone in this room had to be okay, and her mother couldn't be, and La was in the hallway fighting with systems, and her father was dead.

She resented it. She resented her mother for needing her this completely. She resented that her mother couldn't be a mother right now — couldn't hold *her*, couldn't say *I'm here, baby, we'll get through this*, couldn't sit up in the bed for five minutes so that Persefoni could be the child who lost her father. Her mother was supposed to hold her. Her mother was in restraints. Her mother's heart was failing. And Persefoni's grief — the grief of a girl whose daddy was dead — had no room. Her mother had taken all of it. There was none left for the daughter.

And underneath the resentment, the thought she would carry for years and never say out loud to anyone: *I wish it had been her. I wish my dad were here and my mom had died.* The thought was monstrous. The thought was true. Her father would have held her. Her father would have been the parent. Her father would have let her fall apart. Her mother couldn't. Her mother had never been the one who held the room. George held the room. George was gone. And the only person left who knew how to hold it was sitting in this chair, twenty-three years old, holding her mother's hand, not crying.

Démion arrived Sunday night.

La had told her in the car. Somewhere between the airport and Sacred Heart, somewhere in the blur of the morning, La had said it — *I called Démion, he knows, he's — he said he's playing.* La's voice on that word, *playing*, had carried something Persefoni heard but didn't process, because her father had just died and the processing of anything else was impossible. But she heard it. She filed it.

He knew. La had called him Saturday night. La had called him again Sunday morning, from the hospital parking lot, after George died. He knew her father was dead. And the Cowboys game was Sunday afternoon and he played.

He played.

He walked into the hospital late Sunday night — after the game, after the flight from Dallas, after the hours it took the machine to release him. The hospital adjusted to him the way every room adjusted to him — the size, the presence, the physical fact of six-six and two hundred and fifty pounds moving through a corridor designed for smaller people. He found her in the hallway outside her mother's room and his arms opened and she walked into them.

The walking-into was complicated. Relief and disappointment in the same breath. The size of him, the solidity, the rock — the body she needed. And underneath the needing, in the place where the filed thing lived, the sadness of a woman who now knew exactly where she ranked. Not anger. She didn't have the energy for anger. She'd been George all day — holding her mother's hand, filling the room, saying the things that needed to be said in the voice that needed to say them. She was exhausted in a way that went deeper than the body. And the man whose arms were around her had known since Sunday morning that her father was dead and had played a football game.

He held her. He held her the way he held everything — totally, with the body, the holding a physical act that required no words. She pressed her face into his chest and cried. She hadn't cried yet — not in the car with La, not in the hospital with her mother. She had been vertical. She had been the person holding the room. And the person holding the room doesn't cry because crying is what you do when someone else is holding the room and until this moment no one else was.

She stopped. His chest was the place she stopped. And the crying was everything she'd been carrying since the phone rang — the grief, the fear, the exhaustion. The man whose body was here now but whose choice was still in Dallas.

He didn't speak. He held her. The corridor smelled like antiseptic and the fluorescent lights buzzed above them and the machines in her mother's room beeped through the closed door. La was first. La had been first since Saturday night. Démion was here now, and the here was real, and the here was not enough to undo the fact that it was late.

She was in his arms. The arms were enough.

For now, the arms were enough. For now, the enough didn't include the question she couldn't ask — *why did you play* — because the asking would require looking at the answer and the answer was the distance, the real distance, the one that couldn't be measured in miles.

Four years. The field, the lights, the Sundays. The smell of the box — leather seats, cold air conditioning, the faint sweetness of someone's perfume mixing with the popcorn from the level below. The sound of sixty thousand people becoming one sound. Four years of the machine running, the wins blurring into parades and the losses blurring into next-years and the whole golden, enormous, impossible thing becoming the texture of her life.

They won in 2023. The confetti was red and pewter and it fell like weather and she was in the box with Ashli and Kelli and her dad was screaming at a volume the stadium could not contain and the three women were holding each other and crying and laughing and the confetti was in her hair and she thought: *this is what it feels like.* Not as a statement. As a temperature.

They won again in 2024. The second one was different — not less, but different. Champa Bay was the name now, the city rewritten around the fact of Démion Reyes, banners on every skyline. Her dad was at the parade, shirtless, on someone's shoulders — a sixty-year-old man, six-four, two hundred and forty pounds, on the shoulders of a stranger who was also shirtless and also screaming, and Persefoni had watched from the float and laughed until her ribs ached.

They lost in 2025. They lost again in 2026. Other teams had adjusted. Other quarterbacks had studied him. Démion was still Démion — the numbers obscene, the highlights surreal, the body doing things that should have been retired to mythology — but the math had shifted. One man against a league that had spent four years learning to be afraid of him and had finally learned to use the fear.

She didn't track the shift. She tracked other things.

The brand. Millions of followers on Instagram, millions more across platforms she'd stopped counting. Brand partnerships arriving in her inbox every week — predictable, enormous, constant. La had built a team around the team: assistants, accountants, lawyers. The money had stopped surprising her. There was just the magnitude.

Sheepey. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge who'd been born on a road trip to a philosophy festival named after a line of poetry — two girls in the back seat, a gift shop, a stuffed animal that became a person because they decided he was one. The comedy was theirs and nobody else's. Sheepey was a Netflix show now. Two seasons in, produced in LA, the kind of phenomenon that defied every metric the industry used to measure success — a children's show that adults watched with the devotion of a congregation. It was Bluey. It was the thing Bluey was: made for kids, devoured by parents, the kind of show where a thirty-year-old man watched one episode and immediately ordered the plush. The Sheepey plush was everywhere. She saw him in airports. She saw him in strollers. She saw the sheep she'd given a gambling problem and a Stonehenge membership card and a history of unfortunate investments in Victorian horse breeding on the shelves of children who had never heard of Persefoni Minton and didn't need to because Sheepey had outgrown his creator the way rivers outgrow their source.

She didn't think about Kathleen when she saw the plush. She didn't think about the bedroom or the phone or the cross-legged girl with the warm hazel eyes who had been the first audience. Sheepey belonged to the world now. The world didn't know about the bedroom.

Her dad in Gulfport. Fifteen minutes away. The phone calls after every game — every game, every Sunday, the deep warm voice arriving in her ear before the shower was cold: "BABY GIRL. DID YOU SEE THAT. DID YOU SEE YOUR MAN." He never waited for her to call. He called her. She could picture him on the porch, the crimson Alabama cap tilted back on his head, the sunset behind him turning the Gulf red. The reaching was the thing — not the conversation that followed, not the analysis. Just the reaching.

Her mom in the bungalow. The curtains. The guest room always ready. The candle on the nightstand that smelled like vanilla, replaced before it burned out — the invisible labor of making someone else's choices livable. Her mom at the door every time Persefoni came over, the door already open before she knocked, as if she could hear the car from inside the kitchen. Maybe she could. Maybe the listening was that precise. "There she is," her mom would say. The same words every time.

The trio. Still intact. Still real. Ashli and Kelli and Persefoni — the triangle that had formed at the Wine House over backsplash jokes and never stopped forming. Thursday dinners when the schedule allowed. Saturday brunches when the schedule allowed. The group text that never slept — Kelli sending listings of absurd houses with captions that made Persefoni spit out her coffee, Ashli responding twelve hours later with one sentence that was funnier than everything that preceded it, the rhythm of three women who had found the thing they were together and kept finding it. The trio held. The dropped pass was in the room — always in the room, the way weather is in the room, present even when nobody mentions it — but the room was bigger than the pass. The room had been bigger since the Wine House.

Four years of golden. The life she'd built at eighteen had become the life she lived at twenty-three, and the seam between building and living had disappeared the way a river disappears into a delta — still moving, no longer distinct.

She didn't notice other things.

His schedule. Sunday was his day. Tuesday was their day. Wednesday through Saturday was preparation, which meant Wednesday through Saturday was hers — her freedom shaped by his absence, her independence carved from the negative space of his career. She didn't see it. It was everywhere, constant, the air she breathed.

She adapted. Her brand operated around his schedule. Her visits to the Gulfport bungalow happened on days the schedule allowed. Her dinners with the trio were organized around Sundays and Tuesdays and a week that belonged to a game she didn't play. She'd been doing this for four years. The four years had been golden. She didn't feel the walls. The walls were warm.

March 2026. He left.

Not her — Tampa. He left Tampa. Free agency, the annual reshuffling of the NFL's geography. He signed with the Los Angeles Chargers. The reasons were football reasons: Ladd McConkey, the young receiver who ran routes like a mind reader. Jim Harbaugh, the coach whose instinct matched Démion's — preparation wrapped around the same jazz. The Chargers were building something. Tampa had given him five seasons, two rings, and a city that worshipped him. LA offered the biggest market. The brightest lights.

He didn't deliberate. He was in LA before March was over. New house, new facility, new teammates.

She watched him go. She'd seen him make decisions before — the frictionless certainty of a man who had never confused thinking with doing. He did. The doing was immediate. She loved this about him. Or she'd decided she loved it — the decision so old she couldn't tell it apart from the feeling.

He was in LA. She was in St. Pete.

---

The long distance was supposed to be hard.

It wasn't.

She noticed this through her body, not her mind. She moved differently without him. The condo was the same condo — the twenty-third floor, the bay flat and blue through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the space that had been hers since she was eighteen. But the space felt different. Not emptier. Roomier. She could feel it in the mornings, the bed wider, the coffee slower, the quiet a thing she chose instead of a thing that was left over.

The NFL schedule was gone. Not football — Démion still played, the Chargers' season starting in September, the games happening on the screens in the suite she no longer sat in. But the *schedule* was gone — the organizing principle, the weekly architecture that had shaped her life for four years. Sunday wasn't his day anymore. Tuesday wasn't their day. Wednesday through Saturday wasn't preparation. Every day was just a day, unstructured by someone else's career, and the unstructuring was — spacious. There was no other word. She had room. She had room she hadn't known she didn't have until the room appeared.

She visited her parents in Gulfport on a Tuesday morning because Tuesday mornings were hers now. She showed up at the bungalow unannounced and her dad was on the porch with coffee and the physical newspaper — the actual paper, because George Minton believed in paper the way he believed in Alabama football. He saw her and his face did the thing and his arms went wide and the coffee sloshed and the hug was total, immediate, a man experiencing reunion as a physical event.

"Baby girl! On a TUESDAY!"

She sat on the porch with him and they talked about nothing — the Gulf, the neighbors, the guy three houses down who was building a deck and building it wrong. Her dad's voice carrying across the yard, low and warm, narrating the construction failures with the gravity of a man describing a war. Her mom brought out a second coffee without being asked. The lemon tree moved in the wind off the Gulf.

She went back the next Tuesday morning. And the one after that. The Tuesday visits became her thing — no schedule preventing it, the fifteen-minute drive to Gulfport the simplest joy available to her. Her dad on the porch. Her mom in the kitchen. The bungalow warm and small and exactly itself.

She saw Ashli on a Monday. She saw Kelli for drinks on a Wednesday night. She sat on the floor of Ashli's living room with Ariah and Amari and told them a Sheepey story — the one about the time he'd been invited to a wool-tasting in Salisbury and had arrived three centuries late through no fault of his own — and the kids lost their minds and Ashli watched from the kitchen island with her quiet attention, the look of a woman who saw.

She was in her own life. She didn't have a word for why it felt new. She just kept driving to Gulfport on mornings that used to belong to someone else's calendar.

She told herself she missed him. She did miss him. She missed the body next to her in the morning, the size of him, his arm finding her hip in the dark without waking up. She missed the smell — skin, soap, the underneath thing that was just him. She missed the Tuesday dinners where his leg pressed against hers under the table, a language below the conversation.

But underneath the missing, in the space the missing didn't fill, there was something she couldn't name. Something quieter than happiness. She just drove to Gulfport on Tuesday mornings without checking anyone's schedule.

---

She decided to move.

Not immediately — it took a few months. Spring into summer. The decision built itself inside her without her permission, the body arriving at a destination the mind hadn't mapped.

The logic was clean. They were getting married in two years. Long distance didn't work forever. His career was a ten-year window that didn't bend — the NFL didn't relocate to St. Pete because a quarterback's girlfriend liked the bay. Her brand could operate from anywhere. Her phone worked in LA. Sheepey didn't have a zip code. The Netflix production was already in LA. The meetings were in LA. The entertainment industry, the content industry, the fame industry — everything she did as an influencer and brand was headquartered in the city her man had just moved to. Moving to LA wasn't just following Démion. It was stepping into the center of her own professional world.

All of this was true.

She recognized this and moved past it — the way you move past a mirror in a hallway, catching your own face and choosing not to stop. The brand *could* operate from anywhere. But it operated better from here. The sentence was true. She kept saying it. She said it to La, to Ashli, to the mirror she didn't stop at. She said everything except the thing underneath, which was simpler and older and sounded, when she let it surface, exactly like her mother's voice: *he's there and I should be where he is.*

Démion said *LA* and Persefoni said *it makes sense.* She said *the timing is right.* She said everything except the thing that was true, which was that the man she loved was 2,500 miles away and the distance was more than she could hold.

Her dad followed her to Florida. Her mom followed her dad. Now Persefoni followed Démion.

---

She bought her own place. Santa Monica. Cash. Her name. Not Démion's house — her own house.

She'd been doing this since she was eighteen: buying her own space, maintaining her own address, keeping the gap between her life and his. The condo in St. Pete was across the bay from Tampa — thirty minutes of water, thirty minutes of independence. The Santa Monica place was across the city from Démion's house in Bel Air. Thirty minutes. The same distance. The same bay of independence she'd been maintaining since she was eighteen, transplanted to a different coast.

Kelli wasn't her realtor this time — different market, different state. She missed Kelli during the process, missed the comedy that made the paperwork bearable. The new realtor was competent and professional and not funny.

But the instinct was the same. Cash purchase. Her money. Her name. Her space. Another stone laid down, another foundation that belonged to her and only her. The one thread she never let go of, even as every other thread wrapped around him.

The Santa Monica place was smaller than the St. Pete condo — a two-bedroom near the bluffs, windows everywhere, the Pacific visible from the living room. Different water. Same distance. She stood in the living room on the day she got the keys and the salt air came through the open windows and she could hear the waves below the bluff and she thought of nothing in particular. This was hers.

---

She told her parents in August.

She drove to Gulfport on a Tuesday morning — the Tuesday visit, the ritual that had become the best part of her week, the fifteen minutes of Florida road that ended at the porch where her father sat with coffee and the paper and the running commentary on the neighbor's deck, which was still being built and was still being built wrong. She sat on the porch. Her mom brought coffee. The lemon tree moved in the wind.

"I'm moving to LA."

Her dad didn't blink. His face went immediately and totally to the place it went when he'd decided something was good — the brightness, the widening, the grin arriving before the words.

"Go," he said. "Go be with your man. We're not going anywhere."

He said it the way he said everything — like it was already decided, already good, like the world arranged itself around his enthusiasm. The leaving became his idea just by the way he said *go.*

She wanted to say: *I don't want to go.* She wanted to say: *I'm twenty-three and I've been fifteen minutes from you for four years and the fifteen minutes has been the architecture of my happiness and I'm about to give it up for a man whose career doesn't bend.* She wanted to say: *tell me not to go.*

She didn't say any of this. She said: "You'll come visit. The guest room's going to be ready before I've unpacked."

"BABY GIRL. You couldn't keep us away. Baby, pack a bag."

Her mom looked up from the kitchen — the window above the sink, her face framed by the curtains she'd chosen, the Florida light softened through them. "We'll be right here," her mom said. Quiet. Certain. Something in it Persefoni could hear but not name.

She flew to LA in September. The wind off the Gulf pushed against the plane as it lifted, and then the wind was gone, and then Florida was gone, and then the ground was too far away to belong to.

---

The city was a machine.

Not a metaphor — a machine. Tampa was a football town and St. Pete was a beach town and both of them were warm and human-scaled. LA was something else. The freeways hummed at a frequency she could feel through the car seat. The billboards were forty feet tall. The air smelled like exhaust and jasmine and money. The restaurants had wait lists and the wait lists had wait lists and the whole city operated on a currency of access that pretended to be indifferent to fame.

She was famous here in a way she hadn't been famous in Tampa. In Tampa she was Démion's girlfriend — the most beautiful woman in the box, the influencer with the following, the girl the city had absorbed into the football narrative. In LA she was Persefoni Minton — the brand, the following, the Netflix show, the woman whose sheep was on the side of a bus on Sunset Boulevard. The Netflix Sheepey billboards were everywhere. She saw Sheepey on buildings. She saw the sheep she'd invented with Kathleen in a gift shop at Stonehenge on the side of a studio lot, forty feet tall, the plush dignified face staring down at traffic with the expression of a sheep who had seen better roads.

The meetings started immediately. La had structured the first month like a campaign — studio meetings, brand partnerships, the Netflix production team, the agents and managers and entertainment lawyers who materialized around her. La in LA was La at full power. The cousin-manager who had been running a brand from St. Pete was now at the center of the industry, and the city fit her like a thing she'd been waiting for. The custom tarot deck had launched in September — her design, her artist, seventy-eight cards with gold edges and Sheepey embossed on the backs. She'd drawn the suits from the body: an open palm for cups, her own skin rendered in ink on heavy stock, the lines of the hand visible. A grasping hand for wands — the same skin, the same hand, but closed. Fingers tensed, knuckles visible, the gesture of someone holding on. A mind split open and luminous for swords. A barefoot figure standing on the earth for pentacles. Thursday night Lives where she fanned the deck on camera and turned the cards one by one and a hundred thousand viewers watched the open hand catch the ring light. Another vocabulary the brand absorbed, another channel, the suits and spreads becoming a language her audience spoke back to her in the comments.

Persefoni moved through it. The meetings, the studios, the dinners. She walked into rooms and the rooms relaxed — shoulders dropping, smiles arriving, people leaning forward in their chairs before she'd said anything. She could feel them deciding she was easy. She let them decide.

It wasn't ease. She missed the porch.

She missed the Tuesday mornings. She missed the fifteen-minute drive and the coffee on the porch and her dad's voice narrating the neighbor's deck and her mom's face in the kitchen window. She missed Ashli's living room and Ariah's questions and Amari's conviction that the proper response to any statement was to throw something. She missed Kelli's texts — the one-line texts that arrived at random hours and were funnier than anything she'd say to a hundred million followers.

The trio operated long-distance now. The group text was the same — Kelli's listings, Ashli's delayed responses, the rhythm unchanged. But the voice memos were different. The FaceTime calls were different — their faces blue-lit on her screen, the kitchen behind Ashli pixelated, Kelli's laugh arriving a half-second late. You couldn't save a seat for someone who was 2,500 miles away. The trio was real but it was remote, and remote was a different thing.

She called her dad every Sunday. Not after games anymore — the time zones were wrong, the rhythm disrupted by the geography. But she called. Sundays were still Sundays, and the "BABY GIRL" that hit her ear every week was the same word in the same register at the same volume. She held onto that.

"How's the weather?" her mom asked. Tuesdays.

"It's LA, Mom. It's always perfect."

"Perfect." The word arriving in her mom's mouth with a warmth that was genuine and also something else — a flicker, a ghost, the word *perfect* carrying more weight than the weather deserved. Her mom in the bungalow in Gulfport, in the kitchen, the curtains drawn exactly right, the guest room ready, the house holding the shape of a family that had been rearranged.

"You should come visit," Persefoni said. "Both of you. Come see the place."

"Your father's already planning it. He's got the whole trip mapped out."

"Mapped out."

"He wants to drive."

"Mom. It's a thirty-hour drive."

"He wants to see the country. He says he's never driven across the country and he's not dying without driving across the country."

"He's not dying."

"I told him the same thing. He said 'Rosemary, a man needs to see the land.'"

She could hear her father in the background — the deep voice, the words indistinct, the cadence unmistakable. He was narrating something. He was always narrating something.

"November," her mom said. "For your birthday. He wants to be there for your birthday."

"Tell him to fly."

"I've told him to fly. He says flying is for people who are in a hurry."

She laughed. The refusing to fly was so completely, so immovably George that for the duration of the laugh the distance collapsed and she was on the porch again. Tuesday morning. The coffee warm. The lemon tree moving in the wind.

"November," she said. "Tell him I'll have the guest room ready."

---

November came.

The Santa Monica place was ready — the guest room made up, the sheets new, a candle on the nightstand because her mother always put a candle on the nightstand and Persefoni had inherited the gesture without deciding to. She'd stocked the kitchen. She'd put Alabama football magnets on the refrigerator — a joke, a gift, a thing her dad would see and love. She'd cleaned the bathroom twice because her mom would notice if she'd only cleaned it once.

Her parents were driving. Her dad had won the argument — of course he had. They were driving from Gulfport to Los Angeles, the southern route, the Gulf Coast to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to California. They were stopping at Uncle Ray's house in Alabama on the way — the first stop, just across the Florida border. Her dad's brother. Her dad's hometown.

Her birthday was November 7th. They'd planned to arrive the 6th — a day early, because her dad believed in arriving early the way he believed in Alabama football and physical newspapers. The day before the birthday was the day you showed up.

She tracked their progress through phone calls. Her mom called from the passenger seat — brief, warm, narrating the trip the way her mom narrated everything: as if Persefoni needed to know each detail because each detail was a gift.

"We just left Gulfport. Your father is singing."

She could hear him in the background — the deep voice, the melody not quite a melody, the sound of a man who sang because his body was too full to stay quiet. She couldn't make out the song but she could hear the joy in it, the tuneless conviction of George Minton performing for an audience of one on a highway in the Florida panhandle.

Her mom called again from a gas station in Pensacola. "Your father spoke to the gas station attendant for twenty minutes. I think they're friends now."

She could hear him behind her mom — the voice carrying even through the phone, even across the parking lot, the low warm boom of a man telling a stranger something important about Alabama football or the quality of the brisket in Mobile or the way the Gulf looked this morning. He was narrating. He was always narrating.

The last call came around four. "We're heading to Uncle Ray's. Should be there by dinner." And then her mom's voice pulled away from the phone and Persefoni heard her father's voice, clear this time, shouting from the driver's seat: "TELL HER I LOVE HER. AND ROLL TIDE."

She was laughing when she hung up. She was in the Santa Monica living room, the Pacific flat and silver through the windows, the evening light doing the thing LA light did in November — turning everything amber, gilding the surfaces, the whole city performing its beauty for anyone who looked. She could see the ocean from the couch. She could hear the traffic on PCH below, the ambient hum of a city that never stopped moving. She was twenty-three years old. Her parents were driving to see her. Her birthday was in five days. The guest room smelled like vanilla.

The phone rang at 7:47 PM.

La's ringtone. Not her mom, not her dad. La.

"Persefoni."

La's voice was wrong. La's voice was never wrong — La's voice was the most controlled instrument Persefoni knew, the voice that always sounded like the next step was already handled. This voice was not that voice.

"La. What's wrong?"

"Your dad died."

The words arrived and the words didn't arrive. They were in the room — in the air of the Santa Monica living room, in the amber light, in the ocean through the windows — and they weren't in the room because words like that don't arrive in rooms like this. Rooms like this have candles and guest beds and Alabama magnets on the refrigerator. Rooms like this have fathers who are driving across the country singing in the car.

"What?"

"Persefoni. Your dad had a heart attack at Uncle Ray's house. Your mom called an ambulance. They went to the hospital. He died. I'm so sorry. He died."

"No."

"I need you to listen to me."

"No, La. That's — no. Mom just called me. He was singing. He was in the car *singing.* Three hours ago. He was —"

"I know. I know he was."

"Then they're wrong. The hospital is wrong. They made a mistake. He was *singing,* La."

"He's gone, Persefoni. Aunt Beth called me from the hospital. He's gone."

She was standing and she didn't remember standing. The room was the same room — the couch, the Pacific, the evening light gilding every surface — and nothing in the room made sense. The candle was burning in the guest room. The Alabama magnets were on the refrigerator. She could still hear his voice from the last phone call, the voice shouting from the driver's seat: *TELL HER I LOVE HER. AND ROLL TIDE.* The voice was three hours old. The voice was alive. She could hear it. A dead man's voice doesn't sound like that. A dead man's voice doesn't boom across a parking lot and make his daughter laugh. They were wrong. The hospital was wrong. This was a mistake.

"La. What happened. Tell me what happened."

"Heart attack at Ray's house. Your mom called 911. The ambulance came. They got to the hospital and put him in the waiting room. Your mom was screaming at them — screaming that they needed to help him, that something was wrong. They waited. Ten minutes, maybe more. Then they took him to the cath lab. He died in the cath lab."

"They made him *wait?*"

"I'm booking you a flight. LAX to Birmingham. I'm already booking myself out of Orlando."

"They put him in a waiting room and made him *wait?* While he was having a heart attack? La — they — he was — they could have —"

"I know. I know. Persefoni, I need you to pack a bag."

She couldn't pack a bag. She couldn't move her hands. Her hands were shaking and the shaking was a new thing, a thing that hadn't existed in her body thirty seconds ago, and now it was the only thing her body could do. She was standing in a living room in Santa Monica and her father was dead in Alabama and the two facts couldn't exist in the same world. One of them was wrong. The hospital was wrong.

"La. He was fine. He was singing in the car."

"I know. Pack the bag. Clothes. Toothbrush. Charger. I'll get you everything else."

She went to the bedroom. She opened a suitcase. She put a shirt in it and stood there looking at the shirt. The shirt was a thing that belonged to a world where you packed shirts because you were going somewhere and the going made sense. Nothing made sense. She picked up the candle from the guest room — the vanilla candle, the one she'd bought for her mother — and put it in the suitcase. She didn't know why.

"Can you get to the airport? Persefoni? Can you get an Uber?"

"I can — yes."

"Don't drive. Get a car. The flight is in two hours. I'll call you when I have the confirmation."

She opened the app. She ordered the car. She put pants in the suitcase. She couldn't find her shoes — they were by the door where they always were and she couldn't find them because her eyes weren't working, her eyes were looking at the shoes and not seeing the shoes because her eyes were seeing her father's face on the porch in Gulfport, the face that went wide and bright when she pulled into the driveway, the face that was three hours ago alive and singing and now was — now was —

She found the shoes. She looked down at them. White tennis shoes. Her dad had bought them for her in August, the last time she'd flown home — a random Tuesday, Gulfport, the two of them at the outlet mall because George wanted to walk around and George couldn't walk around a mall without buying something for his daughter. He'd picked them out. He'd insisted. *"Baby girl, those are YOU."* She'd worn them home and hadn't thought about them since.

She was looking at the shoes and the thought arrived with the weight of something falling from a great height: *They said he died, but that can't be true, because if he died, these are the last shoes he'll ever buy me. And these can't be the last shoes. There will be other shoes. He'll see other shoes in other stores and he'll hold them up and say "baby girl" and I'll roll my eyes and wear them home. There will be other shoes. There have to be other shoes.*

She put the shoes on. She picked up the suitcase. She walked out the door.

---

The Uber driver was a man in his fifties with a clean sedan and a quiet radio. She got in the back seat and the suitcase went in the trunk and the car pulled away from the curb and she was crying before they reached PCH.

She didn't make a sound. The tears came and she let them come and the driver looked in the rearview mirror once, twice, and said nothing. The radio played something soft. The traffic on the coast highway moved in both directions, cars carrying people who were going to dinner or coming home from work or living their Saturday evening the way Saturday evenings are lived — without the knowledge that someone's father has just died in an Alabama hospital after being made to wait in a waiting room while his heart failed.

She wanted to stop every car. She wanted to stand in the middle of PCH and scream: *My father is dead. My father is dead and you're all just driving.* The world was still operating. The world didn't know. The traffic lights still changed from green to yellow to red and the ocean was still silver through the gaps between the buildings and the Uber driver was still driving and none of them knew and the not-knowing was obscene. How could you not know? How could you be in the same city as a woman whose father just died and not feel it in the road, in the air, in the way the light hit the water?

The driver pulled into LAX departures. She got out. She stood on the curb with the suitcase and the people flowed around her — travelers, luggage, the organized chaos of a Saturday night at an airport — and she couldn't move. She couldn't make her legs work. The automatic doors opened and closed, opened and closed, people walking through them as if walking were a thing people could do, as if one foot went in front of the other foot and this was a sequence the body knew how to perform.

She put one foot in front of the other foot. She walked through the doors. She walked to the counter and the woman behind the counter said something and Persefoni said something back and the words were the right words because the woman handed her a boarding pass, and Persefoni took the boarding pass and walked toward security and every step was a separate decision, a separate act of will, the body doing what the body had been told to do by a brain that was somewhere else entirely.

The terminal was bright and full of people and none of them were looking at her. None of them could see it. She was a woman in tennis shoes carrying a suitcase with a candle in it and no underwear and her father was dead and not a single person in this terminal was stopping to say *dear God, someone help that woman.* She caught her reflection in the terminal glass — a woman in tennis shoes, suitcase in hand, face composed, moving through a building the way people move through buildings. She looked like everyone else. She looked fine. She stared at the reflection and the reflection stared back and neither of them looked like a woman whose father had just died.

La's voice through the phone, in her ear, the line still open: "Gate 22. You're in 14A. Boarding in forty minutes. Sit down somewhere."

She sat. She held the phone. She held it the way you hold the only thing keeping you in a building that's falling, and La was on the other end not saying anything, just there, just the sound of La breathing and typing and managing the world while Persefoni sat in a plastic chair at gate 22 and tried to understand that her father was dead.

She couldn't understand it. She kept returning to the same thought, the same loop, the thought that wouldn't let her out: *This is a mistake. They're wrong. He was singing. You don't die three hours after you were singing. That's not how it works. He was fine. He was singing in the car and his voice was the loudest thing on the highway and you don't die with a voice like that. The hospital made a mistake. Someone will call. Someone will call and say they were wrong and he's alive and he's at Uncle Ray's house and he ate too much and Mom is going to call me and say "your father ate too much" and I'm going to laugh and everything will be —*

"Persefoni. They're boarding."

She boarded.

---

The plane was silence.

No wifi. No messages. No blue bubbles arriving with information she could hold or fight or answer. The plane was a metal tube in the dark and she was sealed inside it and the sealing was total — no connection to the ground, no connection to La, no connection to anything except the engine noise and the dark outside the window and her own head.

La had sent one message before she boarded. Three words on the screen, the last thing she'd see for four hours: *I love you.*

She held the phone. The phone was dark. The message was on the screen and the screen was the only light and she read the three words and the three words were not enough and they were the only thing she had. She read them again. She held the phone against her chest.

The cabin was dim. The engines droned. The stranger in 14B was a woman her mother's age — blonde, small, reading a paperback with the overhead light on, the yellow circle of light falling on the pages like a small warm room. The woman hadn't looked at her. The woman was reading a paperback the way people read paperbacks on planes — unhurried, calm, the posture of a person whose evening had gone the way evenings go.

She pressed her face to the window. The window was cold. Below her, somewhere in the dark, the country was passing — the desert, the mountains, the enormous emptiness of the middle of America. Her father was somewhere below her. His body was in a building in Alabama and she was above it, passing over it, the distance between them measured not in miles but in the fact that he was dead and she was alive and the plane was carrying her toward a place where his body was and his body was the only thing left and even the body she couldn't have because the body was in Alabama and she was landing in Birmingham and she didn't know where Alabama was in relation to the plane and the not-knowing was another kind of sealed.

*This is a mistake.* The loop. *They're wrong. He was singing.*

The flight attendant came through with the cart. "Can I get you anything?" She shook her head. The flight attendant moved on. The cart rattled down the aisle, the small bottles of water and juice and the packets of pretzels, the ordinary machinery of a flight that was ordinary for everyone on it except her.

She was going to call him tomorrow. She was going to call him and his phone was going to ring in a house or a hospital or wherever they kept the things that belonged to dead people and no one was going to answer. She was never going to hear *BABY GIRL* again. The sound was gone. The sound that had been the first sound she reached for every Sunday, the sound that hit her ear and made the distance collapse — the sound was gone and she couldn't get it back and she was in a plane and the plane was taking her toward a version of the world where that sound didn't exist anymore and she didn't want to land. She wanted the plane to stay in the air forever. She wanted the sealed dark and the engine noise and the cold window because as long as she was in the air she was between the world where he was alive and the world where he was dead and the between was the last place that didn't hurt.

The woman in 14B closed her book. The overhead light clicked off. In the new darkness, the woman turned toward her.

"Are you all right, honey?"

"My dad died."

The words came out before she decided to say them. They came out in a voice she didn't recognize — flat, factual, the voice of a person reporting something that happened to someone else.

The woman's face changed. The face softened. The book came down to the woman's lap and her body turned fully toward Persefoni and the turning was the first thing that had felt like being seen since the phone rang.

"Oh, sweetheart. When?"

"I don't know. Tonight. A few hours ago. I think they made a mistake."

The woman reached across the armrest and put her hand on Persefoni's hand. The hand was warm. Persefoni's breath caught.

She didn't fall apart. She held. She held because there was no one here to catch her if she didn't. Hold. Hold because no one else could. Hold because her father held and her father was gone and someone had to.

The woman kept her hand there. The engines droned. The dark was outside and inside and everywhere, and the plane moved through it carrying a woman in white tennis shoes toward a world she didn't want to arrive in.

She didn't sleep. She held the phone with the three words on the screen. She held the stranger's hand. She held.

Birmingham.

The airport was small and bright and wrong. She walked off the plane and into the terminal and the terminal was a place that didn't know her father was dead. The baggage claim carousel turned. People waited for suitcases. A family was laughing near the rental car counter. She walked past all of it — no checked bag, just the carry-on she'd packed without thinking, the body on autopilot — and out through the sliding doors into the November air.

She ordered an Uber. The app worked. The app was designed to work — tap, confirm, wait — and the working of it was obscene, the way the world just kept functioning. The car arrived in four minutes. A silver Camry. The driver said something she didn't hear. She got in the back seat and gave him the address of the Hampton Inn and the car moved and she was in it and the city passed outside the windows — dark streets, traffic lights, the anonymous sprawl of a place she'd never been and didn't want to be.

Her mother had driven to Birmingham. Persefoni understood this slowly, the way she was understanding everything now — in pieces, delayed, the information arriving but the processing broken. Her mother had been at the hospital in Alabama when George died. Her mother had been in the waiting room. Her mother had watched them take George to the cath lab and had screamed at them to help him and had waited and had been told. And then her mother had gotten in the car and driven to Birmingham — an hour, maybe more — because Persefoni's flight landed in Birmingham and someone needed to be there when she arrived. Her mother, whose husband had just died, had driven an hour and checked into a hotel and texted the room number and waited. Her mother had done this.

The Hampton Inn was off the interstate. She paid the Uber driver without looking at him. The lobby was bright and empty and smelled like carpet cleaner. She didn't check in — her mother had texted the room number. Third floor. She took the elevator. The hallway was long and quiet and the carpet was the carpet of every Hampton Inn in America and the doors were identical and the room number was 312 and she stood in front of it and knocked.

The door opened and her mother was there.

Rosemary. Small — smaller than Persefoni remembered, or maybe the same size and the world had gotten bigger around her. She was wearing a sweater Persefoni had seen a hundred times, the cream-colored one she wore when she was cold, and her face was the face of a woman who had been crying for hours and had stopped because the body runs out. Her eyes found Persefoni's face and the finding was the first thing that looked like gravity — two bodies pulled toward each other because the third body that had held them both in orbit was gone.

Her mother's arms went around her. The arms were small and the hug was total and fierce in a way that surprised her — the strength in it, the refusal to let go, the grip of a woman holding the last piece of the thing that had been her family. Her mother smelled like the car — hours of driving, of hotel soap, of the particular staleness of a woman who had spent the worst night of her life in a building she didn't know.

"Mom."

"Baby."

They stood in the doorway and held each other and the hallway was empty and the ice machine hummed somewhere down the corridor and Persefoni felt her mother's body shaking and the shaking was small and constant, a tremor running through her like a current that wouldn't stop.

La was on the phone. La was in the air, flying from Orlando, arriving tomorrow morning. Tonight it was just the two of them — Persefoni and Rosemary in a hotel room in Birmingham, the man who held them both gone.

The room was clean and anonymous — two queen beds, a desk, a window that looked out at a parking lot. The bedspread was a pattern that belonged to every Hampton Inn in America and the lamp between the beds made a circle of yellow light on the nightstand.

They sat on the same bed. They didn't talk. There was nothing to say that could be said in words, and the words that existed — *he's gone, he's dead, your father is dead, my husband is dead* — were words neither of them could say out loud because saying them out loud would make them true, and the only thing keeping either of them upright was the shared, unspoken agreement that this was still a mistake. They were wrong. The hospital was wrong. He was singing.

Her mother lay down. Persefoni lay down next to her. The bed was small for two people but neither of them moved to the other bed. Persefoni listened to her mother's breathing — shallow, uneven, the breathing of a woman whose body hadn't decided whether to keep going. She listened until the breathing slowed. She listened until her mother was asleep, or something close to sleep, the exhaustion finally heavier than the grief.

She didn't sleep. She lay in the dark and listened to her mother breathe and stared at the ceiling and the ceiling was popcorn texture from the 1990s and the texture was the ugliest thing she'd ever seen and the ugliness was appropriate because everything was ugly now. Everything in the world was ugly because her father was dead and ugliness was the only honest response.

---

Her mother woke her at four in the morning.

"Persefoni. Baby. I don't feel good."

She sat up. The room was dark. Her mother was sitting on the edge of the other bed — she'd moved at some point in the night — and her face in the light from the parking lot was gray. Not pale. Gray. A color that didn't belong on a living person's face.

"I've been throwing up. Since midnight. I can't stop."

"Do you need to go to urgent care?"

"I think so. Something's wrong."

Persefoni found her phone. 4:12 AM. She searched for urgent care in Birmingham, Alabama, and the results came back with hours — 8 AM, 9 AM, 7 AM. Nothing open. Everything closed. The world at four in the morning was a place where urgent care didn't exist and the only option was the one her mother didn't want.

"Mom. We have to go to the hospital."

Her mother's face tightened. The tightening was small but Persefoni could see it — the flinch, the involuntary recoil, the body refusing the word *hospital* because the last hospital had taken her husband and given back nothing.

"It's just nausea. I just need something for the nausea."

"Mom. You're gray. We need to go."

"I don't want to go to the hospital."

"I know."

"Persefoni. I don't want to go to the hospital."

"I know, Mom. We have to."

She drove. She didn't know the roads. The GPS guided her through Birmingham at four in the morning, the streets empty, the traffic lights cycling for no one, the city a dark shape around them. Her mother was in the passenger seat with her arms wrapped around herself and her head against the window and the color in her face was wrong, still wrong, the gray deepening.

The emergency room was bright and cold and smelled like every emergency room — antiseptic, plastic, the particular chemical tang of a place designed to keep people alive. Persefoni checked her mother in. The intake form asked for symptoms. She wrote *nausea, vomiting since midnight, husband died eight hours ago.* The nurse looked at the form. The nurse looked at Rosemary. The nurse took her back.

Persefoni sat in the waiting room. The waiting room was beige and fluorescent and there were four other people in it — a man with his arm in a makeshift sling, a woman with a child asleep across her lap, a teenager staring at his phone. She sat in a plastic chair and held her own phone and her father was dead and her mother was behind a door and she was in a waiting room in Birmingham, Alabama, at four in the morning, twenty-three years old, alone.

They came to get her after forty minutes. A doctor — young, serious, a man whose face carried the specific weight of someone who was about to say something terrible. He brought her to the room where her mother was lying on a gurney, connected to a monitor, the gown too big for her, the hospital bracelet loose on her wrist.

"Your mom is having a heart attack."

She heard the words. The words did not make sense. The words were in the same category as *your dad died* — words that belonged to a different conversation, a different night, a different family. Not her family. Not again. Not eight hours later.

"What?"

"The EKG shows ST elevation. We're seeing troponin levels consistent with acute myocardial infarction. We need to move her to the cath lab."

"She came in for nausea."

"Nausea is a common presentation in women. Especially under extreme stress. We're seeing what looks like stress cardiomyopathy — Takotsubo — possibly progressing to a full MI. We need to act now."

She looked at her mother. Her mother was looking at the ceiling. Her mother's face was the gray face of a woman whose heart was breaking — literally, medically, the organ failing because the man it had been built around was gone. It looked to Persefoni like her mother's body was doing what her mother's body had always done: following George. Wherever George went, Rosemary went. George went to Florida and Rosemary went to Florida. George went to Gulfport and Rosemary went to Gulfport. George died and now Rosemary's heart was trying to follow.

She walked out of the room. The hallway was bright and she walked into it and the walking was not a decision, the walking was the body refusing to be in that room for one more second, because that room contained a world where her father was dead and her mother was having a heart attack and both of those things were true and both of those things were happening to her and she was twenty-three years old and she could not do this. She could not do this.

She was in the hallway and the hallway was long and fluorescent and at the end of it, walking toward her, was La.

La. Walking down the hallway of a Birmingham hospital at five in the morning, still in the clothes she'd traveled in, her bag over her shoulder, her face tight and focused — already, from thirty feet away, something shifting in her expression as she closed the distance, the face adjusting the way La's face always adjusted when the world needed managing.

Persefoni's legs stopped. She stopped walking and her legs gave and she didn't fall because the wall was there and she leaned into the wall and then she was on the floor, her back against the wall, her knees pulled up, and La was there, La was kneeling in front of her, La's hands were on her face.

"I can't do this." The words came out broken. The holding broke. The thing she'd been doing since the phone rang — the holding, the being vertical, the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other — the thing broke. "La, I can't do this. This can't be my life. They can't both die. They can't both —"

"They're not both going to die." La's voice. The instrument. The controlled thing that controlled the world. "I'm here. Where is she?"

"Room — back there. La, she's having a heart attack. He died and now she's having a heart attack. I can't — I can't —"

"I'm here. I'm going to handle this. Persefoni. Look at me."

She looked. La's face was close and La's eyes were red — red from the flight, from the night, from something Persefoni could see but couldn't name.

"I'm here. She's going to be okay. I need you to sit in this chair and let me talk to the doctors. Can you do that?"

She could do that. She could sit in a chair. That was a thing she could do because La was here and La was going to handle it and the handling was the only thing between Persefoni and the floor.

Birmingham Heart Clinic at St. Vincent's.

They moved Rosemary that morning — the ER to the cardiac ICU, the transfer La fought for, the better facility with the better doctors and the better machines. La handled the insurance. La handled the paperwork. La handled the world the way La handled the world: by refusing to let it fail.

The CICU was a labyrinth. Three sky bridges from the parking garage, past the cafeteria where the smell of institutional coffee and reheated food hung in the air like a warning, into a hallway that led to another hallway that led to a set of doors you had to be buzzed through, and then an elevator shaft that went up two floors, and then another set of doors, and then the last hallway. Twenty minutes from the parking lot. Twenty minutes of walking through a building that didn't want you to find the place where the sickest people were, as if the architecture itself was trying to protect you from what you'd find when you got there.

The last hallway. She would walk it every day for seven days and the hallway would become the most familiar place in the world — more familiar than the Santa Monica living room, more familiar than the porch in Gulfport, the hallway she walked to reach her mother the way she used to drive fifteen minutes to reach her father. The walls were olive green — not a green anyone had chosen, a green that had happened, the color of a decade that believed in institutional surfaces, a 1972 green that had yellowed and darkened and become the color of endurance. The walls were depressing in the way only old hospitals are depressing — not cruel, not cold, just tired. A building that had seen too many people walk this hallway toward something they didn't want to see.

The handrails. Big, wide, white oak — 2x4 lumber, slightly curved, running the full length of both walls. The stain was the stain you saw on old things, ugly things, things people kept from their grandmother's house — a light oak from a time when light oak was what wood looked like, before anyone thought about what wood *should* look like. The handrails were smooth from decades of hands. The surface had been polished by the palms of everyone who had walked this hallway — every husband, every daughter, every mother, every child who had reached out and touched the wood because the wood was the last thing before the room.

She rested her hand on it the first time without thinking. The wood met her palm at the base of her middle finger and the curve of the rail followed the curve of her hand down to the heel of her palm. It fit. The rail fit her hand the way certain things fit — not designed to, not measured for, but fit, the accident of a shape meeting a shape. She closed her fingers around it and walked and the wood was warm from the hands that had come before her and the warmth was the only warmth in the building.

She touched it every time. Every morning, every evening, every time she walked the hallway to reach her mother — she put her hand on the rail and the rail was there and the rail fit and the touching was the last thing she did before she went into the room. A ritual she didn't name. A handrail she didn't think about. The wood holding her hand the way her father had held her hand, gently, because the holding was big enough to be gentle.

Seven days. Persefoni and La in the CICU. Seven days of machines and monitors and nurses whose faces she learned to read the way you learn to read weather — the good days legible in the softening of their mouths, the bad days legible in the way they didn't quite meet her eyes. Seven days of the slow time of a cardiac ICU, the time that wasn't measured in hours but in vital signs, in the beeping that was the same beeping every hour of every day, in the fluorescent light that didn't change because there were no windows and the sun didn't exist inside this building.

She learned the rhythms. The shift change at seven. The rounds at nine. The quiet hour after lunch when the nurses charted and the hallway emptied and the only sound was the machines and the ventilation system pushing air through ducts that had been pushing air since before she was born. She learned which nurse would tell her things and which nurse would redirect her to the doctor and which nurse brought her coffee without being asked — a woman named Darlene, large, fifties, who said nothing and did everything and whose silence was the kindest sound in the building.

La was there. La slept in the chair by the window — if you could call it sleeping, the head tilted back, the phone in her hand even in sleep, the body that had been running since Saturday night running still. La handled the insurance calls from the hallway. La handled George's arrangements from the cafeteria — the body in Alabama, the funeral home, the paperwork that follows death like a second death. La handled the world so that Persefoni could sit in the chair beside her mother's bed and hold her mother's hand and be the daughter.

She was the daughter. She was twenty-three years old and she was the daughter and the daughter's job was to sit in the chair and hold the hand and say the things that needed to be said — *you're going to be okay, Mom, I'm here, I'm not going anywhere* — and the saying was a thing she did because the alternative was silence and the silence was the sound of a room where no one held anyone and she couldn't let this room become that room.

Rosemary lived.

The doctors stabilized her. The medications worked. The heart that had tried to follow George was kept in her chest by chemistry and machines and the stubborn refusal of a body to stop when the mind had already stopped wanting to go. On the fourth day the monitor showed improvement. On the sixth day the doctor said *cautiously optimistic.* On the seventh day they started talking about discharge.

Persefoni sat in the chair. Her mother was sitting up — the first time in days, the pillows propped behind her, the gown hanging off her collarbone, the blonde hair lank and unwashed. Her mother looked like a woman who had survived something she hadn't wanted to survive. The color was back in her face but the face was different — the softness was still there, the sweetness, but underneath it a flatness, a ground-floor quality, the look of a woman who had been emptied and didn't seem to care if anything filled her back up.

"Mom. Listen to me." Persefoni's voice. Not her father's voice — she was done borrowing his voice, done filling the room with the sound of a man who wasn't there. Her own voice. Quiet. Firm. "I need you to get it together. You cannot die. You hear me? You cannot do this."

Her mother looked at her. The eyes were the same eyes — the eyes that had been blue and warm in the bungalow kitchen, the eyes that had watched from the window above the sink, the eyes that had said *we'll be right here* on the porch in Gulfport. The eyes were the same and the person behind them was someone Persefoni didn't recognize.

"Whatever."

The word landed in Persefoni's chest and stayed there. *Whatever.* Not screaming. Not fighting. Not pulling out IVs or demanding to see George. Just the smallest word in the language, delivered in a voice that didn't care whether it was heard.

Seven days. Seven days Persefoni had sat in that chair. Seven days of the hallway and the handrail and the machines and the nurses and La sleeping upright in the corner and Persefoni saying *you're going to be okay, Mom* in a voice she'd borrowed from a dead man. Seven days of being George so her mother would have someone to hold onto. And now her mother was sitting up and the first word she chose was *whatever.*

Persefoni stood in the room and her mother looked at the window and the window showed Birmingham and Birmingham was a city neither of them had chosen to be in and outside the window the November light was thin and gray and the light didn't care either.

*Whatever.*

She'd carry the word. She'd carry it the way she carried the shoes and the handrail and the sound of his voice shouting from the driver's seat. She'd carry it and she wouldn't say what it meant because what it meant was too large and too ugly and too close to the truth about what her mother wanted and what her mother didn't want and whether Persefoni's existence was enough to tip the balance. The word that would stay with her wasn't *died* or *heart attack* or *cath lab.* It was the smallest one.

---

Démion arrived Sunday night.

La had told her on Saturday, somewhere in the blur of the first day — the phone against her ear, La's voice delivering information in the order Persefoni could absorb it, the logistics of a life that had shattered. *I called Démion. He knows. He's —* and then the pause, La's pause, the pause that carried something Persefoni heard but couldn't process because her father had just died and the processing of anything else was impossible. *He said he's playing.* La's voice on that word, *playing*, had carried something. Persefoni filed it. The filing was automatic — the body's way of saying *I'll feel this later, I can't feel it now.*

He knew. La had called him Saturday night. La had called him again Sunday morning. He knew her father was dead. And the Cowboys game was Sunday afternoon and he played.

He played.

He walked into the hospital late Sunday night — after the game, after the flight from Dallas to Birmingham, after the hours it took the machine to release him. She heard him before she saw him — the footsteps in the last hallway, the olive green hallway with the white oak handrails, the footsteps too heavy, the corridor adjusting to the physical fact of six-six and two hundred and fifty pounds moving through a space designed for smaller bodies. He still smelled like the plane, like recycled air and deodorant and underneath it the faint chemical tang of athletic tape.

He found her outside her mother's room. His arms opened. She walked into them.

The walking-into was complicated. Relief and grief in the same breath. The size of him, the solidity — the body she needed, the body large enough to hold her the way her father's body had been large enough to hold her, the physical echo that she couldn't think about and couldn't stop feeling. And underneath the needing, in the place where the filed thing lived, the sadness of a woman who now knew exactly where she ranked. Not anger. She didn't have the energy for anger. She'd been holding the room since Saturday night — holding her mother's hand in the hotel, driving to the ER at four in the morning, collapsing in the hallway when La arrived, sitting in the chair for seven days. She was hollowed out. Not just the body — the place behind the body where the holding happened. And the man whose arms were around her had known since Saturday night that her father was dead and had played a football game.

She pressed her face into his chest and cried. She hadn't cried — not really, not the falling-apart kind. She'd cried in the Uber. She'd cried silently on the plane. But the real crying, the kind that starts below the ribs and doesn't stop, the kind that requires someone else to hold the room — she hadn't done that. Because no one else had been holding the room. La held the logistics. La held the world. But the room — the room where Persefoni was a girl whose daddy was dead — no one had held that room. She'd held it herself.

Until now. His chest was the place she stopped holding. The crying was everything she'd been carrying since the phone rang — the grief, the fear, the shoes, the plane, the stranger, the hotel, the ER, the hallway, the handrail, the whatever. The man whose body was here now but whose choice was still in Dallas.

He held her. He held her the way he held everything — totally, with the body, the holding a physical act that required no words. She stopped. His chest was the place she stopped.

He didn't speak. He held her. The hallway smelled like antiseptic and the olive green walls pressed in and the white oak handrail ran the length of the corridor and the machines in her mother's room beeped through the closed door. She could feel it in her chest — the fact that La had been in this hallway since five in the morning. La had been first. Démion was here now, and the here was real, and the here was not enough to undo the fact that it was late.

She was in his arms. The arms were enough.

For now, the arms were enough. For now, the enough didn't include the question she couldn't ask — *why did you play* — because the asking would require looking at the answer and the answer was the distance, the real distance, the one that couldn't be measured in miles.

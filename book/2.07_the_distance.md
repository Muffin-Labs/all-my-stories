Four years is not a number. Four years is a season that kept returning — the field, the lights, the Sundays, the rhythm of a life organized around a game that organized a city that organized a country that organized her weeks. Four years is the machine running. Four years is two Super Bowl wins and two more losses and the wins blurring into parades and the losses blurring into next-years and the whole thing — the whole golden, enormous, impossible thing — becoming the texture of a life she stopped noticing because you stop noticing texture when you're inside it.

They won in 2023. The confetti was red and pewter and it fell like weather and she was in the box with Ashli and Kelli and her dad was screaming at a volume that the stadium could not contain and could not quiet and the three women were holding each other and crying and laughing and the crying and the laughing were the same thing and the confetti was in her hair and she thought: *this is what it feels like.* She thought it the way you think things you'll forget — not as a statement but as a temperature, the warmth of a moment that doesn't know it's a moment because the people inside it are too busy being inside it to step outside and look.

They won again in 2024. The second one was different — not less, but different. The first championship is discovery. The second is confirmation. The city had already rewritten itself around the fact of Démion Reyes. Champa Bay was the name now — the city that won everything, the bay that reflected back a skyline full of banners. Her dad was at the parade, shirtless, on someone's shoulders — a sixty-year-old man, six-four, two hundred and forty pounds, on the shoulders of a stranger who was also shirtless and also screaming, and Persefoni had watched from the float and laughed until her ribs ached because her father was the only man alive who could make a victory parade look like a family reunion he'd organized by accident.

They lost in 2025. They lost again in 2026. The losses were different from the first loss — not the floor dropping, not the almost. They were the losses of a team that had been the best and was still the best but the best was no longer enough. Other teams had adjusted. Other quarterbacks had studied him. The machine was still running but the machine was running against machines that had been built specifically to stop it. Démion was still Démion — the numbers obscene, the highlights surreal, the body doing things that should have been retired to mythology — but the math had shifted. One man against a league that had spent four years learning to be afraid of him and had finally learned to use the fear.

She didn't track the shift. She tracked other things.

The brand. The brand was a universe now — not a career, not a business, a universe with its own gravity and its own weather. Millions of followers on Instagram, millions more across platforms she'd stopped counting. The brand partnerships arrived in her inbox the way seasons arrived on the calendar — predictable, enormous, constant. La managed the architecture. La had built a team around the team — assistants, accountants, lawyers, the infrastructure of a business that generated revenue at a scale Persefoni had stopped being surprised by because surprise was a function of contrast and there was no contrast anymore, just the magnitude, just the machine running.

Sheepey. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge who'd been born on a road trip to a philosophy festival named after a line of poetry — two girls in the back seat, a gift shop, a stuffed animal that became a person because they decided he was one. The comedy was theirs and nobody else's. Sheepey was a Netflix show now. Two seasons in, produced in LA, the kind of phenomenon that defied every metric the industry used to measure success — a children's show that adults watched with the devotion of a congregation. It was Bluey. It was the thing Bluey was: made for kids, devoured by parents, the kind of show where a thirty-year-old man watched one episode and immediately ordered the plush. The Sheepey plush was everywhere. She saw him in airports. She saw him in strollers. She saw the sheep she'd given a gambling problem and a Stonehenge membership card and a history of unfortunate investments in Victorian horse breeding on the shelves of children who had never heard of Persefoni Minton and didn't need to because Sheepey had outgrown his creator the way rivers outgrow their source.

She didn't think about Kathleen when she saw the plush. She didn't think about the bedroom or the phone or the cross-legged girl with the big doe eyes who had been the first audience, the only audience, the audience before the audience. She didn't think about it because the not-thinking had become structural — a wall she'd built so gradually she'd forgotten it was a wall. Sheepey belonged to the world now. The world didn't know about the bedroom. The world didn't need to.

Her dad in Gulfport. Fifteen minutes away. The phone calls after every game — every game, every Sunday, the deep warm voice arriving in her ear before the shower was cold: "BABY GIRL. DID YOU SEE THAT. DID YOU SEE YOUR MAN." He never waited for her to call. He called her. The calling was the thing itself — not the information, not the analysis, not the conversation about the game that would follow. The calling. The reaching. The man on the porch in Gulfport who picked up the phone the way he picked up everything: immediately, totally, as if the reaching were the same as the having and the having was joy.

Her mom in the bungalow. The curtains. The guest room always ready. The candle on the nightstand that smelled like vanilla, replaced before it burned out, the replacement invisible the way all of her mom's work was invisible — the labor of making someone else's choices livable. Her mom at the door every time Persefoni came over, the door already open before she knocked, as if her mom could hear the car from inside the kitchen — and maybe she could, maybe the listening was that precise, the ears of a woman whose daughter was fifteen minutes away tuned to the specific sound of that car in that driveway. "There she is," her mom would say, and the saying was the same every time and the sameness was the simplest, most stable thing in Persefoni's life.

The trio. Still intact. Still real. Ashli and Kelli and Persefoni — the triangle that had formed at the Wine House over backsplash jokes and never stopped forming. Thursday dinners when the schedule allowed. Saturday brunches when the schedule allowed. The group text that never slept — Kelli sending listings of absurd houses with captions that made Persefoni spit out her coffee, Ashli responding twelve hours later with one sentence that was funnier than everything that preceded it, the rhythm of three women who had found the thing they were together and kept finding it. The trio held. The dropped pass was in the room — always in the room, the way weather is in the room, present even when nobody mentions it — but the room was bigger than the pass. The room had been bigger since the Wine House.

Four years of golden. Four years of everything working — the machine, the brand, the family, the friendships, the man, the bay, the city that was hers. Four years of the life she'd built at eighteen becoming the life she lived at twenty-three, and the becoming was so smooth, so continuous, so free of rupture that she couldn't have told you when the building stopped and the living started. She was inside the life the way you're inside weather. She didn't notice it. She was it.

She didn't notice other things.

The schedule. His schedule. The NFL calendar organizing her weeks the way gravity organizes orbits — not through force but through the quiet, constant pull of a system that was there before she arrived and would be there after she left. Sunday was his day. Tuesday was their day. Wednesday through Saturday was preparation, which meant Wednesday through Saturday was hers, which meant her freedom was a function of his absence, which meant her independence was shaped by the negative space of his career. She didn't see this. She didn't see it the way you don't see air — it was everywhere, it was what she breathed, and the breathing was so constant it didn't register as a thing that could be different.

She adapted. She adapted the way water adapts to a riverbed — not by deciding to, but by flowing. Her brand operated around his schedule. Her visits to the Gulfport bungalow happened on days the schedule allowed. Her dinners with the trio were organized around Sundays and Tuesdays and the specific architecture of a week that belonged to a game she didn't play. She'd been doing this for four years. The four years had been golden. The adaptation and the golden were the same thing, and the sameness was the trap, and the trap was invisible because it was lined with love.

March 2026. He left.

Not her — Tampa. He left Tampa. Free agency, the annual reshuffling of the NFL's geography, the moment when loyalty meets economics and economics wins. He signed with the Los Angeles Chargers. The reasons were football reasons and the football reasons were good: Ladd McConkey, the young receiver who ran routes like a mind reader, whose body seemed to know where Démion's arm was going before the arm knew. Jim Harbaugh, the coach who read the game the way Démion played it — instinct wrapped in preparation, the chess player to Démion's jazz musician. The Chargers were building something. They wanted Démion to be the center of it. Tampa had given him five seasons, two rings, and a city that worshipped him. LA offered the biggest market. The brightest lights. The confirmation machine turned up to maximum.

He didn't deliberate. The decision was made and the execution followed and there was no gap between them because there never was with Démion. He was in LA before March was over. New house, new facility, new teammates. The machine didn't pause. The machine relocated.

She watched him go and the watching was simple. She'd seen him make decisions before — the proposal, the investments, the choices that organized his life with the frictionless certainty of a man who had never confused thinking with doing. He did. The doing was immediate. And the immediacy was one of the things she loved about him, or one of the things she'd categorized as love, the categorization happening so long ago she couldn't distinguish the category from the feeling anymore.

He was in LA. She was in St. Pete.

---

The long distance was supposed to be hard.

It wasn't.

She noticed this the way you notice a room is bigger than you thought — not through measurement but through movement. She moved differently without him. The condo was the same condo — the twenty-third floor, the bay flat and blue through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the space that had been hers since she was eighteen. But the space felt different. Not emptier. Roomier. The distinction mattered: empty is loss, roomy is possibility, and the distinction lived in her body before it arrived in her mind.

The NFL schedule was gone. Not football — Démion still played, the Chargers' season starting in September, the games happening on the screens in the suite she no longer sat in. But the *schedule* was gone — the organizing principle, the weekly architecture that had shaped her life for four years. Sunday wasn't his day anymore. Tuesday wasn't their day. Wednesday through Saturday wasn't preparation. Every day was just a day, unstructured by someone else's career, and the unstructuring was — spacious. There was no other word. She had room. She had room she hadn't known she didn't have until the room appeared.

She visited her parents in Gulfport on a Tuesday morning because Tuesday mornings were hers now. She showed up at the bungalow unannounced and her dad was on the porch with coffee and the newspaper — the physical newspaper, the actual paper, because her dad believed in paper the way he believed in Alabama football, as an article of faith that didn't require justification. He saw her and his face did the thing and his arms went wide and the coffee sloshed and the hug was the same hug it always was: total, immediate, the embrace of a man who experienced reunion as a physical event.

"Baby girl! On a TUESDAY!"

She sat on the porch with him and they talked about nothing — the Gulf, the neighbors, the guy three houses down who was building a deck and building it wrong, her dad's running commentary on the deck-building a kind of ambient narration she could have listened to forever. Her mom brought out a second coffee without being asked. The porch. The morning. The lemon tree. The wind off the Gulf moving through the yard in the way wind moves through everything — without seizing, without staying, touching and releasing.

She went back the next Tuesday morning. And the one after that. The Tuesday visits became a thing — her thing, the thing she did because she could, because no schedule prevented it, because the fifteen-minute drive to Gulfport was the simplest, most unmediated joy available to her. Her dad on the porch. Her mom in the kitchen. The bungalow warm and small and exactly itself.

She saw Ashli on a Monday. She saw Kelli for drinks on a Wednesday night. She sat on the floor of Ashli's living room with Ariah and Amari and did the Sheepey voice — the drunk dignified sheep explaining to two small children why Mondays were a conspiracy invented by Romans who hadn't slept well — and the kids lost their minds and Ashli watched from the kitchen island and the watching was the same watching it had always been, the quiet attention of a woman who saw.

She was in her own life. She was in her own life the way she hadn't been in her own life for four years — not because Démion had taken it, not because she'd given it away, but because the gravity had been so constant, so ambient, so woven into the structure of her weeks that she'd forgotten what her weeks felt like without it. Now she remembered. The remembering wasn't a thought. It was a temperature. The warmth of a woman standing in her own sunlight.

She told herself she missed him. She did miss him. She missed the body next to her in the morning, the size of him, the way his arm found her hip in the dark without waking up. She missed the smell — skin, soap, the underneath thing that was just him. She missed the Tuesday dinners where his leg pressed against hers under the table and the pressing was its own language, a communication that happened below the conversation the way bass happens below melody.

But underneath the missing, in the space the missing didn't fill, there was something she couldn't name. Not happiness — happiness was too simple, too legible. Something quieter. The feeling of being in her own orbit instead of someone else's. The feeling of a planet discovering it has its own sun.

She didn't think this thought. She didn't think: *I am more myself without him.* She just drove to Gulfport on Tuesday mornings without checking anyone's schedule.

---

She decided to move.

Not immediately — it took a few months. Spring into summer, the months accumulating the way sand accumulates in an hourglass, each grain a conversation she didn't have with herself. The decision built itself inside her without her permission, the way all her real decisions built themselves — not through analysis, not through pro-and-con, but through the body's slow arrival at a destination the mind hadn't mapped.

The logic was clean. They were getting married in two years. Long distance didn't work forever. His career was a ten-year window that didn't bend — the NFL didn't relocate to St. Pete because a quarterback's fiancée liked the bay. Her brand could operate from anywhere. Her phone worked in LA. Sheepey didn't have a zip code. The Netflix production was already in LA. The meetings were in LA. The entertainment industry, the content industry, the fame industry — everything she did as an influencer and brand was headquartered in the city her man had just moved to. Moving to LA wasn't just following Démion. It was stepping into the center of her own professional world.

All of this was true.

She recognized this and didn't linger on the irony: the professional justification for the personal decision. The Emissary's logic — optimization, strategy, the move that made the most sense — giving language to a decision that was actually about love, or dependence, or the inability to name the difference. The brand *could* operate from anywhere. But it operated better from here. The sentence was true and the truth was a kind of permission and the permission was what she needed because the real reason — *he's there and I should be where he is* — was a sentence she couldn't say without hearing her mother's voice inside it.

She didn't hear it. She didn't hear the echo: her dad said *this one* and her mom said *of course* and the family moved. Démion said *LA* and Persefoni said — what? She said *it makes sense.* She said *the timing is right.* She said *I've been thinking about it.* She said everything except the thing that was true, which was that the man she loved was 2,500 miles away and the 2,500 miles was more than she could hold and the not-holding was the same as choosing and the choosing was the same as following.

Her dad followed her to Florida. Her mom followed her dad. Now Persefoni followed Démion. The pattern was right there. She was inside it.

---

She bought her own place. Santa Monica. Cash. Her name. Not Démion's house — her own house.

She'd been doing this since she was eighteen: buying her own space, maintaining her own address, keeping the gap between her life and his. The condo in St. Pete was across the bay from Tampa — thirty minutes of water, thirty minutes of independence. The Santa Monica place was across the city from Démion's house in Bel Air. Thirty minutes. The same distance. The same bay of independence she'd been maintaining since she was eighteen, transplanted to a different coast.

Kelli wasn't her realtor this time — different market, different state. She missed Kelli during the process, missed the comedy that made the paperwork bearable, missed the woman who turned house-hunting into material. The new realtor was competent and professional and not funny, and the not-funny was a loss she felt in her body the way you feel the absence of music when you're used to music.

But the instinct was the same. Cash purchase. Her money. Her name. Her space. The one thread she never let go of, even as every other thread wrapped around him.

The Santa Monica place was smaller than the St. Pete condo — a two-bedroom near the bluffs, the kind of place that felt like air, windows everywhere, the Pacific visible from the living room in the way the bay had been visible from the twenty-third floor. Different water. Same distance. She stood in the living room on the day she got the keys and looked at the ocean and thought of nothing in particular and the nothing-in-particular was the point — this was hers, this room, this air, this view of water that belonged to nobody's schedule.

---

She told her parents in August.

She drove to Gulfport on a Tuesday morning — the Tuesday visit, the ritual that had become the best part of her week, the fifteen minutes of Florida road that ended at the porch where her father sat with coffee and the paper and the running commentary on the neighbor's deck, which was still being built and was still being built wrong. She sat on the porch. Her mom brought coffee. The lemon tree moved in the wind.

"I'm moving to LA."

Her dad didn't blink. Her dad's face went immediately and totally to the place her dad's face went when he'd decided something was good — the brightness, the widening, the grin that preceded the words the way dawn precedes the sun.

"Go," he said. "Go be with your man. We're not going anywhere."

The generosity was total and immediate, the way all of her dad's generosity was total and immediate. He filled the goodbye with warmth the way he filled everything — the room, the porch, the lemon tree's shadow, the entire fifteen-minute radius of Gulfport that had become his kingdom. He made the leaving feel like the leaving was his idea, his gift, his blessing — as if him giving permission was the thing that made it possible. The narrator. The man who narrated everyone's story, including their departures from his.

She wanted to say: *I don't want to go.* She wanted to say: *I'm twenty-three and I've been fifteen minutes from you for four years and the fifteen minutes has been the architecture of my happiness and I'm about to give it up for a man whose career doesn't bend.* She wanted to say: *tell me not to go.*

She didn't say any of this. She said: "You'll come visit. The guest room's going to be ready before I've unpacked."

"BABY GIRL. You couldn't keep us away. Baby, pack a bag."

Her mom looked up from the kitchen — the window above the sink, the face framed by the curtains she'd chosen, the curtains that softened the Florida light into something gentler. "We'll be right here," her mom said. And the saying was quiet and certain and carried something Persefoni could hear but not name — the steadiness of a woman who had organized her entire life around being exactly where her husband put her, and the being-exactly-where was not complaint and was not surrender and was something that Persefoni, at twenty-three, didn't have the vocabulary for.

Her mom meant: *I will be in this house. In this town. Waiting.* The mirror doesn't move.

She flew to LA in September.

---

The city was a machine.

Not a metaphor — a machine. Tampa was a football town and St. Pete was a beach town and both of them were warm and human-scaled in a way that LA was not. LA was built for the industry the way a factory is built for the product — the infrastructure visible everywhere, the entertainment complex humming at a frequency she could feel in the air. The billboards were bigger. The cars were faster. The restaurants had wait lists and the wait lists had wait lists and the whole city operated on a currency of access that was different from fame and adjacent to fame and dependent on fame while pretending to be indifferent to fame.

She was famous here in a way she hadn't been famous in Tampa. In Tampa she was Démion's girlfriend — the most beautiful woman in the box, the influencer with the following, the girl the city had absorbed into the football narrative. In LA she was Persefoni Minton — the brand, the following, the Netflix show, the woman whose face was on the side of a bus on Sunset Boulevard. The Netflix Sheepey billboards were everywhere. She saw herself on buildings. She saw the sheep she'd invented in a bedroom in Beaverton on the side of a studio lot, forty feet tall, the plush dignified face staring down at traffic with the expression of a sheep who had seen better roads.

The meetings started immediately. La had structured the first month like a campaign — studio meetings, brand partnerships, the Netflix production team who wanted to discuss season three, the agents and managers and entertainment lawyers who materialized around her like weather. La looked like a woman who had been waiting for this city her whole career. La in LA was La at full power — the cousin-manager who had been running a brand from St. Pete now operating at the center of the industry, the machine recognizing the machine, the gears engaging with the satisfaction of parts that had been designed to fit together.

Persefoni moved through it. She moved through the meetings and the studios and the dinners and the events the way she moved through everything — with the easy, instinctive navigation of a woman who had been famous since she was seventeen and had learned to treat fame the way fish treat water. She was good at this. She had always been good at this. The personality was the instrument and the instrument was virtuosic and the virtuosity was so natural, so unforced, that she could see the people in the rooms relax around her, as if what she was doing looked easy.

It wasn't ease. She missed the porch.

She missed the Tuesday mornings. She missed the fifteen-minute drive and the coffee on the porch and her dad's voice narrating the neighbor's deck and her mom's face in the kitchen window. She missed Ashli's living room and Ariah's questions and Amari's conviction that the proper response to any statement was to throw something. She missed Kelli's texts — the one-line texts that arrived at random hours and were funnier than anything she'd say to a hundred million followers.

The trio operated long-distance now. The group text was the same — Kelli's listings, Ashli's delayed responses, the rhythm unchanged. But the voice memos were different. The FaceTime calls were different. You couldn't save a seat for someone who was 2,500 miles away. The trio was real but it was remote, and remote was a different thing.

She called her dad every Sunday. Not after games anymore — the time zones were wrong, and the Chargers played at different times than the Bucs had, and the rhythm of the phone call had been disrupted by the geography the way all rhythms had been disrupted by the geography. But she called. She called on Sundays because Sundays were still Sundays, and his voice on Sundays was still his voice, and the "BABY GIRL" that hit her ear every week was the same word in the same register at the same volume and the sameness was a thread she held onto.

"How's the weather?" her mom asked. Tuesdays.

"It's LA, Mom. It's always perfect."

"Perfect." The word arriving in her mom's mouth with a warmth that was genuine and also something else — a flicker, a ghost, the word *perfect* carrying more weight than the weather deserved. Her mom in the bungalow in Gulfport, in the kitchen, the curtains drawn exactly right, the guest room ready, the house holding the shape of a family that had been rearranged.

"You should come visit," Persefoni said. "Both of you. Come see the place."

"Your father's already planning it. He's got the whole trip mapped out."

"Mapped out."

"He wants to drive."

"Mom. It's a thirty-hour drive."

"He wants to see the country. He says he's never driven across the country and he's not dying without driving across the country."

"He's not dying."

"I told him the same thing. He said 'Rosemary, a man needs to see the land.'"

She could hear her father in the background — the deep voice, the words indistinct, the cadence unmistakable. He was narrating something. He was always narrating something. The background noise of her father was the sound of a man who experienced silence as a thing that needed filling and filled it with the warmth of his own voice, always, the filling as natural as breathing.

"November," her mom said. "For your birthday. He wants to be there for your birthday."

"Tell him to fly."

"I've told him to fly. He says flying is for people who are in a hurry."

She laughed. The laugh was the laugh of a woman who was 2,500 miles from her parents and could hear her father refusing to fly in the background and the refusing was so completely, so totally, so immovably George that the distance collapsed for a moment — just a moment, just the duration of the laugh — and she was on the porch again, Tuesday morning, the coffee warm, the lemon tree moving in the wind.

"November," she said. "Tell him I'll have the guest room ready."

---

November came.

The Santa Monica place was ready — the guest room made up, the sheets new, a candle on the nightstand because her mother always put a candle on the nightstand and Persefoni had inherited the gesture without deciding to, the inheritance arriving in her hands the way all of her mother's gestures arrived in her hands, quietly, without announcement. She'd stocked the kitchen. She'd put Alabama football magnets on the refrigerator — a joke, a gift, a thing her dad would see and scream about. She'd cleaned the bathroom twice because her mom would notice if she'd only cleaned it once.

Her parents were driving. Her dad had won the argument — of course he had, her dad won every argument by making the argument feel like an adventure he was inviting you on, the invitation so warm and so total that refusal felt like refusing joy itself. They were driving from Gulfport to Los Angeles, the southern route, the Gulf Coast to Texas to New Mexico to Arizona to California. They were stopping at his brother's house in Alabama on the way — the first stop, just across the Florida border, a few hours into the drive. Her dad's brother. Her dad's hometown. The place her dad had been before he'd been anywhere else.

Her birthday was November 14th. They'd planned to arrive the 13th — a day early, because her dad believed in arriving early the way he believed in Alabama football and physical newspapers and putting the window down before the ignition was fully on. Early arrival was an article of faith. The day before the birthday was the day you showed up, because showing up was the point and the point deserved an extra day.

She tracked their progress through text messages. Her mom texted from the passenger seat — brief, sweet, the texts of a woman who typed with one finger and punctuated everything with a period because her mom treated text messages like letters and letters deserved punctuation.

*Left Gulfport this morning. Your father is singing.*

*Stopped for gas in Pensacola. Your father spoke to the gas station attendant for twenty minutes.*

*Heading to your uncle's house. Should be there by dinner.*

*Your father says to tell you he loves you and also Roll Tide.*

She smiled at the phone. She was in the Santa Monica living room, the Pacific flat and silver through the windows, the late-afternoon light doing the thing LA light did — turning everything golden, gilding the surfaces, the whole city performing its beauty for anyone who looked. She could see the ocean from the couch. She could hear the traffic on PCH below, the ambient hum of a city that never stopped moving. She was twenty-three years old. Her parents were driving to see her. Her birthday was in three days. The guest room smelled like vanilla.

The Chargers were playing the late game. She had it on — not watching, not really, the screen more habit than attention, the game a presence in the room the way Démion was a presence in every room even when the room was 2,500 miles from his body. She could see him on the screen, the number 2 jersey, the arm, the release. The announcers said his name and the name was the name she'd been hearing for six years and the hearing was ambient now, the sound of a life organized around a man who was on television every Sunday.

The phone rang at 9:47 PM. Third quarter.

It wasn't her mom's ringtone. It wasn't her dad's ringtone. It was La's ringtone — the specific buzz she'd assigned to Lauria Wilson, the cousin-manager who called about brand deals and production schedules and contract negotiations and never called at 9:47 PM on a Sunday unless something had gone wrong with a partnership or a deal or a —

"Persefoni."

La's voice was wrong. La's voice was always controlled — the voice of a woman who had built a career on the specific skill of making information sound manageable, every crisis a problem to be solved, every disaster a narrative to be shaped. La's voice on this call was not controlled. La's voice was holding something and the holding was visible in the sound, the way a bridge holds weight and the holding is visible in the tension of the cables.

"La."

"Listen to me. Your dad — your dad had a heart attack."

The room didn't change. The Pacific was still silver. The traffic on PCH was still humming. The candle in the guest room was still burning, the vanilla still moving through the air of a house that was ready for a man who was not coming.

"He's at the hospital. In Alabama. Your uncle called me. He's alive, Persefoni. He's alive."

The word *alive* was the word La chose, and the choosing of the word *alive* was the information — not the word itself, but the fact that La had to say it, had to lead with it, had to put it at the front of the sentence the way you put a wall in front of a flood. You don't say *alive* when alive is assumed. You say *alive* when alive is the thing that might not be true.

"I'm booking you a flight. Pensacola — it's the closest airport. I'll meet you there. I'm already driving."

La was already driving. La was already in the car, already on the road, already moving toward the crisis with the speed of a woman whose body responded to catastrophe the way other people's bodies responded to adrenaline — not with panic but with motion, the motion the thing that kept the world functional. La had been called by her dad's brother and had gotten in the car before she'd called Persefoni and the order of operations was La's: handle first, inform second. The machine running even now.

"The hospital — it's small, Persefoni. It's rural. I'm going to make sure they—"

"Is he going to be okay?"

The pause was La's answer. La didn't pause. La never paused. La's pauses were the pauses of a woman who was choosing words, and the choosing meant the words that came naturally were the wrong ones.

"He's alive. They're working on him. I'll know more when I get there."

She was standing. She didn't remember standing — the body had stood without consulting the mind, the way the body does things in crisis, the body knowing that standing is the first thing, that vertical is the posture of a person who is about to move. She was standing in the living room of the Santa Monica house that was supposed to hold her parents in two days and the living room was the same room and the room was not the same room. On the screen behind her, Démion threw a pass. The crowd cheered. The game continued. The game didn't know.

"I'll text you the flight. Pack now. Go to the airport. I'll be there when you land."

La hung up. La hung up the way La did everything — cleanly, efficiently, the conversation ending at the moment the conversation had served its purpose. The purpose was: move.

She moved.

---

The flight was not a flight. The flight was a duration — a block of hours that had to pass, four and a half hours of sitting in a seat while the country moved beneath her, while the distance between her body and her father's body closed at a speed that was enormous and also not fast enough. Nothing was fast enough. The plane was traveling at five hundred miles per hour and five hundred miles per hour was a crawl, was a stillness, was the specific torture of moving toward someone you need to reach and the movement taking time and the time taking everything.

She was in the middle seat. She hadn't chosen the middle seat — La had booked the first available flight and the first available seat was a middle seat on a red-eye, the plane half empty, the passengers around her sleeping or pretending to sleep and the pretending was what people did on red-eyes, the collective agreement to close their eyes and let the hours pass. She couldn't close her eyes. Her eyes were open and the open eyes saw nothing — not the seat back in front of her, not the oval window to her left where the country was dark below, not the phone in her hand that was on airplane mode because the plane required airplane mode and the requiring was a cruelty so specific she wanted to put her fist through the screen. She couldn't call. She couldn't text. She couldn't know.

She was in the air. Her father was on the ground. The air was between them. The air was the distance and the distance was everything.

La texted updates before the flight. The hospital was small — rural Alabama, the kind of place where the nearest hospital was twenty minutes and the nearest *good* hospital was two hours. Her uncle had called 911 from the house. The ambulance came. They brought him to the closest ER. La was driving from St. Pete — eight hours, the full width of the Florida panhandle and then across the Alabama border — and La was driving because La was the kind of person who drove, who moved toward the thing, who put her body in the car and the car on the road and the road between herself and the crisis. La was always the first person at the hospital. La was always the one who got there before anyone else and made the system answer to her.

Persefoni sat in the middle seat and didn't sleep. She thought about her father's hands. She thought about his hands around the coffee mug on the porch in Gulfport, the mug small in his grip, the grip the grip of a man who held everything gently because his hands were big enough that gentleness was the only option — if he gripped, things broke, so he held, and the holding was soft, and the softness was the thing she kept seeing when she closed her eyes. His hands on her shoulders at the airport when she was eighteen. His hands lifting her off the ground in the terminal, every time, every reunion, the hands that made reunion a physical event.

She thought about Alabama. His Alabama. The place he'd been before he'd been anywhere else — before Beaverton, before Intel, before her mom, before her. Alabama was in his blood the way it was in hers. Roll Tide. The call-and-response that preceded everything, the family frequency that predated language. He was at a hospital near the place where that frequency was born, and the nearness was — she couldn't finish the thought. The thought had a shape she didn't want to see.

The plane descended toward Pensacola. The sun was coming up. The Gulf was visible from the window — a gray line, barely distinguishable from the sky, the water and the air the same color at this hour. She was born in Pensacola. Twenty-three years ago, in a hospital in this city, she'd arrived, and her father's hands had been the first hands, and the first hands were the fact she built everything else on.

Her phone came off airplane mode before the wheels touched the tarmac. The messages arrived like weather.

La: *I'm at the hospital. It's not good. They misdiagnosed him. They treated him for the wrong thing for the first hour. They've corrected but the window — just get here. I'll be at the airport.*

La: *They're doing everything now. The right things now.*

La: *He's in surgery.*

La: *I'm coming to get you. Wheels down, walk straight out, I'll be at arrivals.*

She walked off the plane and through the terminal and La was there. La was standing at arrivals with car keys in her hand and her face set in the expression Persefoni had seen exactly once before — the expression La wore when the system was failing and La was not going to let the system win. La's face was not soft. La's face was the face of a woman at war with a bureaucracy, and the war was visible in the jaw, in the eyes, in the way she reached for Persefoni's bag without asking and started walking toward the car before the greeting was finished.

"Talk to me," Persefoni said.

La drove. La talked. The talking was efficient — no warmth, just information, La's voice stripped down to the thing it needed to be. The facts: her dad had had a massive heart attack at his brother's house. Her uncle called 911. The ambulance came. The ER — small, rural, understaffed — misdiagnosed him. Treated him for the wrong thing. The wrong treatment for the first hour, the critical hour, the hour that was the difference between a heart attack you survived and a heart attack you didn't.

"They read the symptoms wrong. He presented — he was big, he was in distress, they went the wrong direction. By the time they corrected, the damage—" La's voice stopped. La's voice stopped the way a machine stops when a part breaks, mid-sentence, the sentence hanging in the air of the car like something physical. "He's in surgery now. They called a specialist from Mobile. It's — the specialist is good. The specialist is the right person."

"Why wasn't the specialist there before?"

"Because the hospital is twenty beds and two doctors and the nearest cardiac specialist is two hours away. That's why."

The car moved through Pensacola and Persefoni watched the city pass — the city where she was born, the city she'd left when she was a baby, the city that existed in her history but not in her memory. The streets were unfamiliar. The light was Florida light, different from Alabama light only in the way the buildings caught it. She was thirty minutes from the hospital. Her father was in surgery. The distance was closing and the closing was too slow and the too-slow was the condition of her life now — everything too slow, every minute too long, every mile too far.

Her phone rang. La's phone, in the cupholder, buzzed at the same time. The simultaneity was the information. Two phones ringing at once meant the hospital was calling everyone it had a number for, and the calling-everyone was a thing hospitals did when —

La answered. La listened. La's face didn't change. It was already set to the worst expression Persefoni had ever seen on it, and the worst had just gotten worse, and the difference was invisible.

La hung up.

"He's gone," La said. "Persefoni. He's gone. He died in surgery. Twenty minutes ago."

Twenty minutes. She'd been in the car for thirty. She'd landed forty minutes ago. The flight had been four and a half hours. The numbers assembled themselves in her mind with the precision of numbers, the math that didn't care about meaning: if the flight had been ten minutes shorter. If she'd gotten to the airport ten minutes sooner. If the first flight hadn't been full and she'd been on it instead of the second. If she'd been in St. Pete instead of LA — eight hours from the hospital instead of a continent and a connection and a delay and a car ride and twenty minutes.

Twenty minutes. She'd missed him by twenty minutes.

La was talking. La was saying things — the hospital, the arrangements, the next steps, the things that La said because La was the woman who turned catastrophe into logistics and the logistics were what kept the world functional when the world was ending. Persefoni heard the words. The words were sounds. The sounds arrived in her ears and did not arrive in her brain because her brain was in the hallway of a hospital she hadn't reached, in the room where her father had been alive twenty minutes ago, in the twenty minutes that were now the distance between this world and the world where she still had a father.

She was in the air. She'd been in the air. Her father died below while she flew above and the flying was the thing she'd chosen — the move, the city, the man, the career, the 2,500 miles she'd put between herself and the porch in Gulfport. She'd been fifteen minutes away. For four years, she'd been fifteen minutes away. And then she'd left, and the leaving had put a continent between them, and the continent had been just wide enough to hold twenty minutes, and the twenty minutes were permanent.

She thought about calling Démion. She picked up her phone. She put the phone down. He was still playing. The game was still happening — the game that didn't know, the game that would not pause, the game that her father had watched every Sunday of every season, the man on the porch in Gulfport screaming at the screen, "THAT'S MY BOY," and the boy was on a field in a stadium and the boy didn't know yet that the man who screamed for him was gone. His phone was in a locker. She knew this. She knew his phone was in a locker because his phone was always in a locker on Sundays, because Sunday was the game and the game consumed everything and the everything included being unreachable, and the unreachable was the thing she'd accepted years ago and the thing that was, right now, in this car on this road in this world without her father, unbearable.

The road trip. They were coming to her. Her parents, driving to LA for her birthday, stopping at his brother's house in Alabama on the way. They were going to see the Santa Monica place for the first time. Her dad was going to walk through the door and his face was going to do the thing and his voice was going to hit the living room at a volume the neighbors would hear and he was going to declare the place perfect before he'd seen the kitchen because that was what her father did — he declared things perfect before he had the evidence, the declaration arriving first, the evidence irrelevant, the perfection a thing he bestowed rather than observed.

He was going to see the Alabama magnets on the refrigerator. He was going to scream.

The car kept moving. La kept driving. The Pensacola streets passed outside the windows and the streets were just streets and the light was just light and the world was the same world it had been thirty minutes ago when her father was alive and the sameness was the cruelest thing — that the world didn't change, that the buildings stayed standing, that the traffic kept moving, that everything continued as if the largest man she'd ever known hadn't just been subtracted from it.

Her mother collapsed the same day.

The call came from the Alabama hospital — the same hospital, the same small rural ER that had misdiagnosed her father. Her mom had been at the brother's house when the ambulance came. Her mom had been in the waiting room for hours. Her mom had been the woman in the chair, the petite blonde in the chair, the wife waiting, the mirror waiting for the thing it mirrored to come back.

The thing it mirrored didn't come back.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Stress cardiomyopathy. The medical term for a broken heart — not a metaphor, not poetry, the literal medical condition where the heart muscle fails because the grief is too large for the organ to hold. Her mother's heart, the heart that had been organized around her father the way the bungalow was organized around him the way her entire life was organized around him, cracked. The muscle that pumped blood through the body of a woman who had never existed without the man who told her where to exist — the muscle failed.

They admitted her to the same rural Alabama hospital where her father had just died. They stabilized her. Then they flew her to Pensacola — better care, better equipment, the hospitals that the rural ER couldn't be. Both of them, back where they were born. Her dad dying in Alabama. Her mom airlifted to Florida.

La handled this too. La handled everything. The cousin-manager who had been hired to run a brand was now running a family crisis across two states — her mother's transfer, her father's body still at the Alabama hospital, the logistics of death multiplied by the logistics of a second emergency. La was on the phone with Alabama and Pensacola simultaneously, the two hospitals like two failing systems she was trying to keep online, her voice the voice of a woman who would not let another system fail today. La argued with administrators. La fought with insurance. La navigated the bureaucratic nightmare that descended on a family when someone died inside a system that wasn't designed to care about them.

La was a force. La was indispensable. La was the Emissary's champion — narrative control, system navigation, the woman who made the machine work when the machine didn't want to work.

La was not enough.

Persefoni arrived at the Pensacola hospital to find her mother in a bed — small, connected to machines, the blonde hair against the pillow, the face without the expression it usually wore because the expression her mother usually wore was the expression that reflected her father and her father was gone and the mirror had nothing to mirror. Her mother's face was a face Persefoni had never seen — not sad, not grief-stricken, not any of the words for the emotions that follow a husband's death. Empty. The face of a woman whose operating system had stopped.

She sat in the chair next to the bed. She held her mother's hand. Her mother's hand was small — she'd forgotten how small, the hand that had braided her hair, the hand that had arranged the curtains, the hand that had picked up the phone every Tuesday and asked about the weather. The hand was cold. The machines beeped. The room smelled like hospitals smell — antiseptic, plastic, the specific odor of a building designed to keep people alive and indifferent to whether the keeping-alive felt like living.

"Mom."

Her mother's eyes were open. Her mother's eyes were looking at the ceiling. The ceiling of a hospital in Pensacola, Florida — the city where her mother had been born, the city she'd left when she married, the city she'd returned to unconscious in a helicopter while her husband's body was in a building across the state line.

"Mom. I'm here."

Her mother's eyes moved. Slowly, as if the moving required effort, as if the muscles that moved eyes were connected to the muscles that had given up. The eyes found Persefoni's face and the finding was the first thing that looked like life — a flicker, a recognition, the mirror finding something to reflect.

"Baby." Her mother's voice was small. Smaller than Persefoni had ever heard it — the voice reduced to a single word, the word barely audible above the machines, the word carrying everything her mother had left.

Persefoni held the hand and didn't let go. She held the hand the way her father had held everything — totally, immediately, the holding a physical event. Outside the room, La was on the phone. Outside the hospital, the sun was up over Pensacola. Outside the world she knew, her father was in a building in Alabama, in a room she would never see him in, the man who declared everything perfect gone from a world that would not be declared perfect again.

Ashli and Kelli flew in.

They didn't have to. They lived in St. Pete — eight hours from Pensacola by car, an hour by plane, not close, not convenient, not the kind of distance that allowed for dropping everything and showing up. They dropped everything and showed up.

Ashli arrived first. She came through the hospital door the way Ashli did everything — quietly, without announcement, the presence arriving before the person was fully in the room. She had a bag from a restaurant and a second bag with things she'd packed — a change of clothes for Persefoni, toiletries, the practical items that a woman in crisis forgets she needs because the crisis occupies the space where practical thinking used to live. Ashli set the bags down and looked at Persefoni and the looking was the looking she'd been doing since the Wine House — the quiet attention, the psychology major's attention, the look that made Persefoni feel entirely seen and not judged for what was visible.

She didn't say *I'm sorry.* She didn't say *how are you.* She said: "Have you eaten?"

Persefoni shook her head.

"Eat." Ashli opened the bag. The food was there and the being-there was the thing — not the food itself, not the calories, but the fact that someone had thought about it, had driven to a restaurant, had ordered something, had carried it through a hospital, had put it in front of a woman who couldn't remember the last time she'd eaten. The thinking-about-it was love in its most useful form.

Kelli arrived two hours later. Kelli came through the door differently — faster, louder, the energy of a woman who had been in motion since the phone call and whose motion was a kind of holding, the speed a refusal to let the distance win. Kelli hugged her. The hug was fierce and long and Kelli said something into her hair that Persefoni couldn't hear because the words didn't matter and the arms did.

They stayed. Both of them. They stayed in Pensacola — the city none of them knew well, the geography unfamiliar, the hospital corridors a maze that La had already mapped and the trio navigated by following La's instructions. Ashli sat with her mom. Ashli sat in the chair next to the bed and held her mother's hand and the holding was the same holding she did with everyone — patient, present, the quiet attention of a woman who never seemed to need to be anywhere else.

Kelli handled the other things — the people who needed to be told, the phone calls to family, the logistics of grief in a city none of them lived in. Kelli was the co-performer who knew when to stop performing and start doing, and the doing was efficient and warm and never once asked for recognition.

The trio held. The trio held because it was real — because three women who genuinely loved each other could carry a grief that no friendship built on fame could bear. The dropped pass was still in the room. The room had just gotten bigger, and the pass was smaller than the grief, and the grief was smaller than the love, and the love was the thing that held.

Démion arrived Monday.

He'd been playing. While she was in the car with La, while she was hearing the words *he's gone*, while Ashli was packing a bag and Kelli was canceling everything and La was fighting with two hospitals across two state lines — Démion was on national television. She'd called him. La had called him. The hospital had called him. None of the calls went through. His phone was in a locker in a stadium on the other side of the country, and the game ran until after ten Eastern, and the man she needed was unreachable in the way he was unreachable every Sunday — except this Sunday the unreachable was unforgivable, even though it wasn't his fault, even though he couldn't have known.

He found out after the game. She didn't know exactly when — sometime after the final whistle, sometime in the locker room, sometime in the window between the body coming off the field and the body reaching the phone. He called her. His voice was the voice of a man who had just learned something his body didn't know how to hold — low, careful, the control in it the kind of control that a man who is never out of control uses when he is very nearly out of control. He said he was coming. He said he'd be on the first flight. The first flight after a Sunday night game was Monday morning. He was on it.

Not late. Not negligent. Unreachable. The game — the thing that was always first — had been first one last time. His phone in a locker while her father died. La was first. Ashli and Kelli were first. The women were first.

He walked into the hospital and the hospital adjusted to him the way every room adjusted to him — the size, the presence, the physical fact of six-six and two hundred and fifty pounds moving through a corridor designed for smaller people. He found her in the hallway outside her mother's room and his arms opened and she walked into them and the walking-into was the thing her body needed — the size of him, the solidity, the rock.

He held her. He held her the way he held everything — totally, with the body, the holding a physical act that required no words because words were not what his body spoke. His body spoke in pressure and warmth and the specific certainty of a frame that was built to absorb impact, and the impact now was her grief, and the frame absorbed it, and the absorbing was what she needed. She pressed her face into his chest and cried. She hadn't cried yet — not in the car with La, not in the hospital with her mother, not with Ashli or Kelli. She had been vertical. She had been moving. She had been the person in the crisis, and the person in the crisis doesn't cry because crying is what you do when you stop moving and she hadn't stopped.

She stopped. His chest was the place she stopped. And the stopping was the crying and the crying was the first time since the phone rang that she was not a woman navigating a catastrophe but a woman whose father was dead, and the being-a-woman-whose-father-was-dead was the thing she'd been holding off and couldn't hold off anymore because the arms around her were big enough to hold it for her.

He didn't speak. He held her. The corridor smelled like antiseptic and the fluorescent lights buzzed above them and the machines in her mother's room beeped through the closed door and Démion held her in the hallway of a Pensacola hospital while her mother's heart tried to decide whether to keep beating and her father's body lay in a building across the Alabama border and the world was different now, permanently different, the distance between this world and the world before measured in twenty minutes and 2,500 miles and a phone call at 9:47 PM on a Sunday in November while the game played on without knowing.

She was in his arms. The arms were enough.

For now, the arms were enough.

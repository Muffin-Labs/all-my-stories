He woke before she did.

The monitors were still on — the blue glow, his color, the room still running, the screensavers not yet triggered because the laptop had been set to *never* months ago when he'd started building tracks that took six hours and couldn't be interrupted. The loop station's display showed the last loaded track: "Stone-HENGE." Five colored buttons glowing in the dark. The monitors were playing "Stone-HENGE" at a volume so low it was almost not there — the sheep choir reduced to a murmur, the loops cycling softly through the speakers the way a record plays after everyone has gone to bed. The song still going. *Don't put me back.* The refrain cycling, barely audible, the plea of a thing that had been picked up and was asking to stay.

His bedroom smelled different. He cataloged this the way he cataloged everything — involuntarily, taxonomically, the sensory data arriving and being sorted before he could decide whether to receive it or analyze it. The room's native smell: electrical tape from the broken mic stand, the faintly chemical warmth of a laptop that ran too hot, cable insulation, the particular staleness of a space that was ventilated by a window cracked two inches and inhabited by a seventeen-year-old who forgot to do laundry. He knew this smell. It was the olfactory signature of his creative life, the air of a room that had been optimized for sound and nothing else.

Now there was something else in it. Her shampoo — something warm, something that had a roundness to it, not floral exactly, more like the smell of a bakery if the bakery also sold small expensive candles. Her skin. The warmth of another body metabolizing the same air, displacing the molecules he'd been breathing alone for months. The room smelled different because the room contained a different person, and the different person was asleep on his pillow, and her curls were on the cotton, and the curls were the color of dark chocolate in the blue light of his monitors. *Huele a ella.* The whole room. Everything.

He watched her breathe.

The blue light — his wavelength, his color, the frequency that had defined his creative space since the first monitor went up on the desk — washed across her skin. The golden brown going silver-blue. His color on her warmth. He watched the blue move on her shoulder as she breathed, the light shifting with each inhalation, the way light shifts on water, and the watching was not clinical. This was not the boy who had cataloged Kathleen's features in the early weeks of their relationship — eyes (hazel, warm, disarming), curves (the feature he'd focused on because it was the feature he could focus on), smile (warm, prompt, reliable). This was not classification. He didn't name what he saw. He didn't sort it. He just looked.

Her curls on his pillow. The way her hand was tucked under her chin, fingers loosely curled, the hand that gestured when she talked — the hand that built muffins and princesses and drunk sheep in the air between them — now still, now small, now just a hand belonging to a sleeping girl in his bed. The curve of her back under the sheet. Her eyelashes — he hadn't noticed her eyelashes before, or had noticed them and classified them and moved on, but in the blue light they cast tiny shadows on her cheekbones and the shadows were the most delicate thing in a room full of cables and hard edges.

*Así.* Just looking. Just this.

But only for a moment. Because the mind that classified everything could not not classify this. The data was arriving — her body, her breathing, her presence in his bed, the fact of what had happened, the fact of what it meant — and the data demanded a framework and the framework was already assembling itself, the way his frameworks always assembled themselves, from the bottom up, premise by premise, each fact supporting the next until the structure stood and the structure told him what the facts meant.

The classification that arrived, slowly, as she breathed and the blue light shifted and the sheep choir whispered into the carpet:

*Me eligió.* She chose me.

---

He didn't wake her. He lay still. He thought about what to say.

This was not manipulation. It was not strategy. It was the way he approached every moment that mattered — the way he'd prepared for the McGilchrist explanation, the way he'd rehearsed the Pitchfork response he'd never need to give, the way the Emissary built a script for any encounter that might require words. He wanted to get it right. He wanted the first words of this new thing — whatever this was, this reconfigured geometry, this topology that had been a triangle and was now something else — to be worthy of what had happened.

He thought about making coffee. He didn't have a coffee maker in his room. He thought about going to the kitchen — down the stairs, past the closed doors, into the bright space where his parents might or might not be awake, where his father might or might not be reading at the counter with the specific absorption of a man who had organized his entire domestic life around the principle of minimal interaction, where his mother might or might not notice the expression on her son's face and file it under *adolescence* without examining it further. He thought about navigating all of this with the energy of a boy whose life had changed overnight and whose body hadn't yet caught up with the change, and he stayed in bed.

He touched her hair. Lightly. One curl, wound around his finger, released. The texture was different from Kathleen's — thicker, denser, each curl holding its own shape against his finger, where Kathleen's hair fell flat against a pillow and didn't announce itself. He caught himself making the comparison and stopped. But not before the data registered. Everything registered. The Emissary could not not catalog.

He lay beside her and he let himself believe what the data was telling him.

She had chosen him. He was sure of it. Not impulsively — not the way people chose things in movies, all sudden revelation and breathless decision. She had chosen him the way she seemed to choose everything: by arriving. *Llegó.* She just — arrived. The way she arrived at observations, at muffin biographies, at the precise word for the thing nobody else could name. He was certain she couldn't have deliberated. She couldn't have weighed the options. She had heard the song and the song had done what music does — it had closed the distance between what was felt and what was said — and the closing was a choice even if it didn't look like one.

He believed this. He needed to believe this, the way the Emissary needed every framework to be internally consistent, the way the map needed to match the territory, the way the hypothesis needed to survive its own evidence. The evidence: she had responded to the song. She had cried. Her body had opened. The distance between them had closed and the closing had been mutual — he had felt her lean, felt her mouth answer his, felt the specific warmth of a body saying *yes* with its weight and its breath and its willingness to be where it was. The data was clear. The data was unambiguous. The conclusion followed.

He had wanted her since the first time she opened her mouth at the lunch table and said something about stones being sheep and the sentence had reorganized his entire taxonomy. Since before England. Since the wanting was a background process he couldn't terminate, running beneath every conversation, every creative session, every midnight in this room where she sat on his bed and said things that arrived at his destination before he did. The wanting had been there — managed, sublimated, channeled into "Careless" and "Enough to See By" and every song that was secretly about her. The system had held it in place. And last night the system broke and the wanting came through and — she wanted it too.

He felt her respond. He saw her tears. He heard her stop breathing when the song landed. Every datum pointed to the same conclusion: she had been wanting this as long as he had, and the song gave them both permission to stop pretending.

The data was accurate. The conclusion followed. The Emissary's proof was clean — every premise supporting the next, every observation confirming the hypothesis, the architecture as sound as anything he'd ever built. He lay beside her and the proof held and the holding felt like arrival.

---

She woke up.

He watched it happen — the way consciousness arrived in her body like a tide coming in, not all at once but in stages. A shift in her breathing first. Then her hand moved, the fingers uncurling from under her chin, reaching for something — the pillow, the sheet, the surface of whatever world she was surfacing into. Then her eyes opened and the pale green caught the blue light and for a moment she looked like someone arriving in a country she didn't recognize.

She saw him.

"Hey," he said. The word he'd rehearsed last. The simplest one. The one that contained the least risk of getting it wrong.

"Hey." Her voice was thick with sleep. She blinked. She looked at the ceiling — his ceiling, not hers, the blue-white flatness of it, the monitors' glow replacing the fairy lights' warmth — and he watched her register where she was. The registration moved across her face like weather — not a single expression but a sequence of them, each one arriving and dissolving before he could classify it. He caught fragments. Surprise, or something like surprise. Recognition. Something he wanted to read as tenderness and couldn't be sure was tenderness. Something that moved behind her eyes and was gone before he could name it.

"What time is it?" she said.

"Six. Maybe six-thirty."

She sat up. The sheet fell away from her shoulder. Her curls were compressed on one side — the side she'd slept on, his pillow's side — and wild on the other, and the asymmetry made her look younger, more vulnerable, more like the girl who had arrived at the stones with a guidebook and less like the girl who had ten million people watching her. She pulled the sheet up. Not dramatically, not in modesty — just the small, unconscious adjustment of a person who had woken up in a place that wasn't her place and was calibrating.

"My parents," she said.

"They won't notice. They never notice."

"My parents."

He heard the difference. Not his parents. Hers. George, who narrated the apocalypse and noticed everything except what he narrated over. Rosemary, who cleaned things that were already clean and watched the door as though she didn't know what she was watching for. Neither of them had noticed the window opening at midnight. But the window had been designed for returning to — the ground-floor sill, the side yard, the easy geometry of a girl going out and coming back. The geometry of a girl not coming back was different, and the difference had a morning in it, and the morning was here.

"I should go," she said.

"Okay." He said it carefully. Not with reluctance — not with the pull of someone trying to keep her there — but with the measured neutrality of someone who understood that the morning after required a different architecture than the night before. He was being careful. He was being the best version of himself. The Emissary doing what the Emissary did: managing the moment, reading the room, presenting the response most likely to produce the desired outcome.

"Okay," she echoed. She didn't move.

The loop station hummed. The sheep choir murmured from the monitors. Six months of midnight sessions had ended here — in this bed, in this light, in this silence between two people who had crossed a line and hadn't yet decided what was on the other side.

She looked at him. The pale green eyes, serious, carrying something he could see but couldn't parse. Something underneath the surface that hadn't been there before — or had been there and he couldn't see it, or had been there and he'd filed it under *creative intensity* or *artistic temperament* or any of the classifications that allowed him to observe her without understanding her.

"Alejandro," she said.

"Yeah."

She didn't say the next thing. Whatever she was carrying — whatever had moved behind her eyes when she woke up, whatever was sitting in the space between her mouth and the words she wasn't saying — stayed where it was. She looked at him for a long moment, the kind of moment that in a movie would have been followed by a confession or a kiss or a declaration, and in this bedroom in Beaverton was followed by Persefoni Minton getting out of bed and finding her shoes.

She dressed with her back to him. He watched her — the line of her spine, the golden brown skin disappearing under fabric, the curls falling over her collar — and the watching held something that surprised him — something that had no entry in his catalog. He had always been careful, precise, attentive in the way of someone who cataloged details the way a librarian cataloged books — comprehensively, systematically, without much emotional investment in the content. But what he felt watching her tie her shoes was something else. Something the system hadn't produced before. Something that arrived from the place below the notebook, the place where music lived, the place the Emissary couldn't reach. *Ternura.* A word he'd only ever heard his mother use — tenderness, but the Spanish carried a softness the English didn't, something almost fragile.

"I'll text you," she said, from the door.

"Yeah."

She left. The way she always left — through the door, down the stairs, past the parents who slept the deep sleep of academics, out the side door into the morning. He heard her footsteps on the stairs. He heard the side door open and close. He heard the silence she left behind, which was different from the silence before she'd arrived, the way a room sounds different after music has been in it.

He lay in the bed that smelled like her shampoo and he stared at the blue ceiling and the staring felt like the beginning of something.

---

He decided to tell Kathleen the same day.

He was sitting on the edge of the bed. The sheet was still warm. The monitors threw blue light across his knees and his phone sat on the desk, face-down, the black rectangle of a thing that hadn't been picked up yet. The decision arrived the way his best decisions arrived — not as a choice but as a conclusion, the last line of a proof that had been assembling itself since he woke up. He believed in integrity. *La verdad.* Not abstractly — the way you believe in a theorem — but viscerally, the way you believe in gravity. He knew that hiding this from Kathleen would be the Emissary's worst instinct — the instinct to manage, to control information, to keep the system running by concealing the data that would break it. He wouldn't do that. He was better than that. The boy who'd read about the Master and the Emissary, who'd understood — really understood, at a level deeper than the notebook — that the Emissary's great sin was the substitution of its own narrative for reality, that boy would not lie to Kathleen. He would tell her the truth. Because the truth was what you owed the people who trusted you.

He framed it this way in his head. The framing was flawless.

The decision felt clean. It felt like the hardest right over the easiest wrong. It felt like the kind of thing a person of integrity did — not confessing, exactly, because confession implied wrongdoing, and what had happened wasn't wrong. It was *something that happened.* He would tell Kathleen that something happened. He would present the new configuration. He would be honest, and the honesty would hurt, and the hurting would be the price of the truth, and the price was worth paying because the alternative was a lie and he was not a liar.

He picked up his phone. He opened FaceTime. He pressed Kathleen's name.

---

She answered the way she always answered.

The face that filled his screen was the face that had filled his screen for three years — open, vivid, those hazel eyes already bright before the connection fully resolved, the smile arriving before the pixels did. The face of a girl who answered her boyfriend's calls with what he'd always taken for the uncomplicated joy of someone who had never been given a reason not to. Her bedroom behind her — the lockdown bedroom, the one he'd seen in a thousand FaceTime calls, the posters and the lamp her parents had bought her and the bedspread that was always slightly rumpled and the normalness of it, the relentless, heartbreaking normalness of a girl's room that was just a room, not a studio, not a production space, just the four walls of a life being lived without an audience.

"Hey, babe." The warmth of her voice arriving through the speaker. The sound of what he'd always read as gladness — someone who seemed always glad to hear from him. The sound of what he'd always taken for gladness itself — unperformed, unrehearsed, as automatic and as real as a heartbeat.

He looked at her face on the screen and the looking was, for the first time, difficult. Not because of guilt — he didn't feel guilty, which was itself a thing he might have examined if the Emissary examined its own architecture. The difficulty was simpler than guilt. The difficulty was that she was smiling at him and he was about to make her stop.

"I need to tell you something," he said.

Her face changed. Not dramatically — a micro-shift, her brow tightening, her eyes going fractionally wider. The shift was small enough that most people would have missed it. Alejandro didn't miss things. He watched the shift happen and he cataloged it — *anticipatory anxiety response, limbic system activation prior to cognitive processing of threat* — and the cataloging was the thing he did instead of feeling what he was seeing, which was: a girl whose face had rearranged itself around the shape of a sentence that had never preceded good news.

"Okay," she said. The warmth was still there but thinner, the way a voice thins when the throat tightens. "What's up?"

He told her.

"Persefoni and I — something happened. Last night. It's been building for a while and I think — I think we both felt it." He paused. The pause was not for effect — it was the Emissary checking the architecture, making sure the next sentence was load-bearing. "I'm telling you because I respect you too much to lie about it."

He said *I respect you too much to lie* and he meant it. Every word. The Emissary's presentation was sincere in the way that the Emissary's presentations were always sincere — internally consistent, structurally sound, built on premises that followed logically from the premises before them. He respected Kathleen. He did not want to lie. Therefore he was telling the truth. The syllogism was clean. The conclusion was defensible. He believed every word.

---

The face on the screen went quiet.

Not the quiet of processing. Not the quiet of someone composing a response. Something else — something Alejandro had never seen on Kathleen's face, which he'd been watching for three years, which he could catalog from memory: the smile (warm, prompt, reliable), the laugh (generous, immediate, the kind that made you want to be funnier), the concern (eyebrows pulling together, lower lip caught between teeth, the physical vocabulary of a girl who worried about people the way other people worried about weather — constantly, involuntarily, with total investment in the outcome). He'd seen all of her expressions. He'd cataloged the full range. He thought he had the complete dataset.

This was not in the dataset. *¿Qué hice?*

Her face went still. The heart-shaped face, the vivid eyes, the girl who said *that's amazing, babe* with exclamation marks that never wavered — went still in a way that was not any of the stillnesses he knew. Not the stillness of attention. Not the stillness of listening. Not even the stillness of hurt, which he'd seen once or twice when she'd come to school with her eyes red and her parents' voices still echoing in her face. This was a different thing. The stillness of a door becoming a wall. The stillness of something that had been open — had been open for three years, had been open since the first time she'd looked at him with those eyes and decided he was worth looking at — closing. Not slamming. Closing the way a stone settles. Quietly, completely, and with the specific permanence of a thing that would not be moved again.

She looked at him through the screen. Her eyes. The same eyes that had watched him play "Enough to See By" and heard something beautiful and missed the yurt. The same eyes that had watched Persefoni's TikToks and said *perfect* and held the phone and bounced on the bed when the numbers climbed. The same eyes that had looked at him in England and chosen him and stayed and stayed and stayed.

Her hand came up to her face. She touched her own cheek — lightly, absently, the way you touch a surface to check if it's real. The rosy cheeks that flushed when she laughed, when she was cold, when she was embarrassed — they weren't flushed now. They were white.

She said something. Something small. He heard the words but couldn't fully hear them — the way you could see a building collapse on a screen but couldn't feel the ground shake. Whatever she said, it wasn't loud. It wasn't a question. It was the shortest sentence she had ever spoken to him — shorter than *that's beautiful, babe,* shorter than *shh,* shorter than anything she'd said in three years of exclamation marks and patience and a playlist with twelve listeners.

She hung up.

The screen went dark. His own face reflected in the glass — the curly hair, the charming smile gone slack, the blue light of the monitors behind him. The Emissary's face in the Emissary's color in the room where everything had happened and was still happening and would keep happening even after the screen went dark. He held the phone and he felt — what? Something he could almost classify. Not guilt, exactly. Something more like the sensation of a structure behaving unexpectedly. He had modeled her response. He had run the scenarios — tears (probable), anger (possible), questions (expected). He had prepared for all of these. He had architecture for tears, for anger, for the conversation that would follow the conversation, for the processing and the pain and eventually — he was certain of this, the way the Emissary was certain of things, categorically, structurally — the acceptance. He had prepared for everything.

He had not prepared for quiet. *El silencio.* The silence that was louder than anything she'd ever said.

The quiet was outside the model. The quiet was the thing the Emissary couldn't classify because the Emissary classified through language and the quiet was the absence of language. The quiet was the sound of a girl who had used more exclamation marks in three years than most people used in a lifetime suddenly using none.

He texted Persefoni. Three words.

*I told Kathleen.*

The text sat on the screen. The period at the end. The three words that looked like the last line of a proof — the thing to be demonstrated had been demonstrated. Q.E.D. The old configuration acknowledged. The new one ready to begin.

He put the phone down. He looked at the loop station. "Stone-HENGE" was still loaded — the display showing the track name in the small blue letters, the sheep choir still in the machine, the song that had broken the triangle still humming in the hardware, ready to sing *don't put me back* to a room that was one person emptier.

---

The first thing he noticed was the absence of texts.

Not the content of the texts — the *existence* of them. Kathleen texted every day. Multiple times a day. The texts had been consistent the way weather was consistent — you stopped noticing them because they were always there, the way you stopped noticing the hum of a refrigerator or the pressure of the atmosphere. They were the ambient condition of his life. Good morning texts that arrived between 7:15 and 7:30 with the regularity of a system clock. Song-reaction texts — she listened to everything he posted, and the reaction arrived within hours, always warm, always specific enough to prove she'd listened and general enough to prove she hadn't heard the yurt. Selfies in her lockdown bedroom with bored expressions and silly filters — the duck face, the dog ears, the one that made your eyes enormous which was redundant on Kathleen because her eyes were already enormous. "How's the new track?" "Miss you babe." "Tell Persefoni I said hi!"

The exclamation marks. Always the exclamation marks. The punctuation of a girl who seemed to experience enthusiasm as a primary emotion, who found things amazing and said so, who ended sentences the way she ended phone calls — with an upward inflection, an opening, a small sonic door left ajar for the other person to walk through. The exclamation marks were her signature. They were the most consistent thing in his life, more consistent than his own creative output, more reliable than the numbers on the Spotify dashboard. Kathleen's exclamation marks. The faithful punctuation of someone who loved him with the kind of love that punctuated itself.

They stopped.

Not gradually. Not trailing off — not the slow diminishment of a signal losing strength, not the fade-out at the end of a track where the sound gets softer and softer until you're not sure if you're still hearing it or just remembering it. They stopped the way a heartbeat stops. One moment present. The next moment the most noticeable absence in the world. He woke up the first morning and there was no good morning text and the phone looked wrong without it — the screen empty where a message should have been, like a face missing a feature. Not a deformity. A subtraction. Something taken from a thing that used to be complete.

He texted her. *Hey.* No response.

He texted again the next day. *Can we talk?* No response.

He tried calling. FaceTime. The sound it made — the double tone, ascending, repeating, the sound of a connection being attempted and not completed — was the loneliest sound he had ever heard. Lonelier than his music. Lonelier than the twenty people in a room who were all him. Because the ringing was a sound designed for two people, a sound that existed only in the space between a caller and a receiver, and one of them wasn't there. The ringing was a bridge with a missing end. The ringing was his voice traveling through the air toward a phone in a bedroom across town, and the air carried nothing back, and the nothing arrived in his room as a series of ascending tones that meant *nobody is here.*

In lockdown, vanishing required no logistics. You didn't need to move, transfer, pack boxes, change cities. You didn't need to make a scene. You just stopped answering. The screen that had connected you became the wall that sealed you off, and the wall was perfect — no cracks, no gaps, no place to press your ear and hear what was on the other side. Digital absence was the purest form of absence — not a door closing but a wind stopping, the kind of cessation you only noticed because the air went still. Physical absence left traces — an empty chair, a gap in a row, a cleared locker. Digital absence left nothing. The screen looked the same whether someone was choosing not to respond or had simply ceased to exist. The pixels didn't care. The interface didn't grieve.

Her Instagram stopped updating. The last post was from before the FaceTime call — a sunset photo from her bedroom window, the sky going orange and purple over the rooftops of whatever Beaverton street her sealed house faced, captioned with a single line. No exclamation marks. No hearts. No tags. Just five words in the tone of someone who had already started leaving:

*the view from here.*

Alejandro looked at the post on his phone and the five words landed with a weight that his taxonomy struggled to hold. *The view from here.* He read the *here* the way the Emissary read everything — as a variable requiring definition. Here being her bedroom. Here being lockdown. Here being the place she'd been sealed inside by parents who checked the doors while her best friend and her boyfriend crossed a line in a room she couldn't reach. He could see the frame: the rooftops, the light, the caption that said nothing and held everything. What the view looked like from her side — what *here* meant to the girl looking out the window — he couldn't access. The five words sat on his screen and he read them and the reading was his and the *here* was hers and the distance between those two things was the distance the Emissary could not cross.

He didn't understand it. He could describe it — *withdrawal behavior, avoidant coping mechanism, the cessation of contact as a self-protective response to interpersonal betrayal* — and the description was accurate the way a blueprint was accurate, all the measurements correct and none of the feeling. He could see the what. He couldn't access the why. Or he could access a version of the why — *she's hurt, I hurt her, the information I provided caused an emotional response she is managing through avoidance* — but the version was the Emissary's version, the version that kept him at the center of the narrative, the version in which Kathleen's disappearance was a response to his action rather than an action of her own.

He could have asked whether her silence was about him or about her. He didn't ask. The question lived at the edge of his framework, in the place where the map ended, and the Emissary did not travel past the edge of the map.

---

Days passed. The days in lockdown passed the way they always passed — shapeless, identical, each one a copy of the one before, the kind of days that dissolved into weeks before you noticed the dissolving. Except now the days had a new absence in them, and the absence had a shape, and the shape was Kathleen.

He felt something about this that he could not name. He sat at his desk and the loop station glowed and his phone lay dark on the surface beside his hand — the phone that used to light up between 7:15 and 7:30 and now lit up only when Persefoni texted, which was different, which was what he'd wanted, which was fine.

The Emissary had categories for most things. Guilt. Regret. Loss. Relief. Sorrow. The taxonomy of negative affect was extensive, refined over years of self-observation, and none of the categories fit precisely. The feeling was not guilt — not the sharp, specific guilt of a person who had done something wrong and knew it. The feeling was not regret — not the backward-looking ache of someone who wished they'd chosen differently. The feeling was something else. Something that lived in the gap between the categories, in the place where the classification system broke down, in the space where the Emissary's map didn't match the territory.

What he felt was the specific discomfort of a system that had achieved its stated objective and produced an outcome the system didn't model. He had told Kathleen the truth. He had been honest. He had been respectful. He had done the honorable thing, the courageous thing, the thing the boy who'd read McGilchrist would do. And the result was a girl who had disappeared — not into anger or grief or any of the responses he'd prepared for, but into silence, and the silence was a room he couldn't enter and couldn't see into and the room was somewhere on the other side of town where a girl was doing something with her devastation that didn't involve him.

He got what he wanted. *El precio.* The cost was a person.

He should feel worse than he did. He knew this. The knowledge that he should feel worse was itself a feeling — a meta-guilt, a guilt about insufficient guilt, the Emissary observing its own inadequate emotional response and classifying the inadequacy as a data point. He filed it. He noted it. He moved on. Because Persefoni was in his bed now. Persefoni texted him back. Persefoni was the revised model, the updated configuration, the thing the system had always been pointed toward, and the thing the system had given up to get there was already becoming an absence he would learn to live inside — the way you learned to live inside any room with a missing wall. By not looking at the gap.

---

Somewhere across town, a phone rang in an empty room. The curtain moved in a draft from a window cracked two inches. The screen lit up, his name on it, the ascending tones filling the space where a girl used to be.

Nobody answered.

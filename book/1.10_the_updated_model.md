He woke before she did.

The monitors were still on — the blue glow, his color, the room still running, the screensavers not yet triggered because the laptop had been set to *never* months ago when he'd started building tracks that took six hours and couldn't be interrupted. The loop station's display showed the last loaded track: "Stone-HENGE." Five colored buttons glowing in the dark. The monitors were playing "Stone-HENGE" at a volume so low it was almost not there — the sheep choir reduced to a murmur, the loops cycling softly through the speakers the way a record plays after everyone has gone to bed. The song still going. The sheep still singing. A grateful drunk delivering a thank-you speech to a room that had stopped listening.

His bedroom smelled different. He cataloged this the way he cataloged everything — involuntarily, taxonomically, the sensory data arriving and being sorted before he could decide whether to receive it or analyze it. The room's native smell: electrical tape from the broken mic stand, the faintly chemical warmth of a laptop that ran too hot, cable insulation, the particular staleness of a space that was ventilated by a window cracked two inches and inhabited by a seventeen-year-old who forgot to do laundry. He knew this smell. It was the olfactory signature of his creative life, the air of a room that had been optimized for sound and nothing else.

Now there was something else in it. Her shampoo — something warm, something that had a roundness to it, not floral exactly, more like the smell of a bakery if the bakery also sold small expensive candles. Her skin. The warmth of another body metabolizing the same air, displacing the molecules he'd been breathing alone for months. The room smelled different because the room contained a different person, and the different person was asleep on his pillow, and her curls were on the cotton, and the curls were the color of dark chocolate in the blue light of his monitors.

He watched her breathe.

The blue light — his wavelength, his color, the frequency that had defined his creative space since the first monitor went up on the desk — washed across her skin. The golden brown going silver-blue. His color on her warmth. The Emissary's light on the Master's surface. He watched the blue move on her shoulder as she breathed, the light shifting with each inhalation, the way light shifts on water, and the watching was not clinical. This was not the boy who had cataloged Kathleen's features in the early weeks of their relationship — eyes (large, doe-like, disarming), bottom (shapely, the feature he'd focused on because it was the feature he could focus on), smile (warm, prompt, reliable). This was not classification. He didn't name what he saw. He didn't sort it. He just looked.

Her curls on his pillow. The way her hand was tucked under her chin, fingers loosely curled, the hand that gestured when she talked — the hand that built muffins and princesses and drunk sheep in the air between them — now still, now small, now just a hand belonging to a sleeping girl in his bed. The curve of her back under the sheet. Her eyelashes — he hadn't noticed her eyelashes before, or had noticed them and classified them and moved on, but in the blue light they cast tiny shadows on her cheekbones and the shadows were the most delicate thing in a room full of cables and hard edges.

The Emissary, for a moment, gathering instead of grasping.

But only for a moment. Because the mind that classified everything could not not classify this. The data was arriving — her body, her breathing, her presence in his bed, the fact of what had happened, the fact of what it meant — and the data demanded a framework and the framework was already assembling itself, the way his frameworks always assembled themselves, from the bottom up, premise by premise, each fact supporting the next until the structure stood and the structure told him what the facts meant.

The classification that arrived, slowly, as she breathed and the blue light shifted and the sheep choir whispered into the carpet:

*She chose me.*

---

He didn't wake her. He lay still. He thought about what to say.

This was not manipulation. It was not strategy. It was the way he approached every moment that mattered — the way he'd prepared for the McGilchrist explanation, the way he'd rehearsed the Pitchfork response he'd never need to give, the way the Emissary built a script for any encounter that might require words. He wanted to get it right. He wanted the first words of this new thing — whatever this was, this reconfigured geometry, this topology that had been a triangle and was now something else — to be worthy of what had happened.

He thought about making coffee. He didn't have a coffee maker in his room. He thought about going to the kitchen — down the stairs, past the closed doors, into the bright space where his parents might or might not be awake, where his father might or might not be reading at the counter with the specific absorption of a man who had organized his entire domestic life around the principle of minimal interaction, where his mother might or might not notice the expression on her son's face and file it under *adolescence* without examining it further. He thought about navigating all of this with the energy of a boy whose life had changed overnight and whose body hadn't yet caught up with the change, and he stayed in bed.

He touched her hair. Lightly. One curl, wound around his finger, released. The texture was different from Kathleen's — thicker, denser, each curl holding its own shape against his finger, where Kathleen's hair fell flat against a pillow and didn't announce itself. He caught himself making the comparison and stopped. But not before the data registered. Everything registered. The Emissary could not not catalog.

He lay beside her and he let himself believe what the data was telling him.

She had chosen him. Not impulsively — not the way people chose things in movies, all sudden revelation and breathless decision. She had chosen him the way she chose everything: by arriving. The way she arrived at observations, at muffin biographies, at the precise word for the thing nobody else could name. She couldn't have deliberated. She couldn't have weighed the options. She had heard the song and the song had done what music does — it had closed the distance between what was felt and what was said — and the closing was a choice even if it didn't look like one.

He believed this. He needed to believe this, the way the Emissary needed every framework to be internally consistent, the way the map needed to match the territory, the way the hypothesis needed to survive its own evidence. The evidence: she had responded to the song. She had cried. Her body had opened. The distance between them had closed and the closing had been mutual — he had felt her lean, felt her mouth answer his, felt the specific warmth of a body saying *yes* with its weight and its breath and its willingness to be where it was. The data was clear. The data was unambiguous. The conclusion followed.

He had wanted her since the first time she opened her mouth at the lunch table and said something about stones being sheep and the sentence had reorganized his entire taxonomy. Since before England. Since the wanting was a background process he couldn't terminate, running beneath every conversation, every creative session, every midnight in this room where she sat on his bed and said things that arrived at his destination before he did. The wanting had been there — managed, sublimated, channeled into "Careless" and "Enough to See By" and every song that was secretly about her. The system had held it in place. And last night the system broke and the wanting came through and — she wanted it too.

He felt her respond. He saw her tears. He heard her stop breathing when the song landed. Every datum pointed to the same conclusion: she had been wanting this as long as he had, and the song gave them both permission to stop pretending.

The data was accurate. The conclusion followed. The Emissary's proof was clean — every premise supporting the next, every observation confirming the hypothesis, the architecture as sound as anything he'd ever built. He lay beside her and the proof held and the holding felt like arrival.

---

She woke up.

He watched it happen — the way consciousness arrived in her body like a tide coming in, not all at once but in stages. A shift in her breathing first. Then her hand moved, the fingers uncurling from under her chin, reaching for something — the pillow, the sheet, the surface of whatever world she was surfacing into. Then her eyes opened and the pale green caught the blue light and for a moment she looked like someone arriving in a country she didn't recognize.

She saw him.

"Hey," he said. The word he'd rehearsed last. The simplest one. The one that contained the least risk of getting it wrong.

"Hey." Her voice was thick with sleep. She blinked. She looked at the ceiling — his ceiling, not hers, the blue-white flatness of it, the monitors' glow replacing the fairy lights' warmth — and he watched her register where she was. The registration moved across her face like weather — not a single expression but a sequence of them, each one arriving and dissolving before he could classify it. He caught fragments. Surprise, or something like surprise. Recognition. Something he wanted to read as tenderness and couldn't be sure was tenderness. Something that moved behind her eyes and was gone before he could name it.

"What time is it?" she said.

"Six. Maybe six-thirty."

She sat up. The sheet fell away from her shoulder. Her curls were compressed on one side — the side she'd slept on, his pillow's side — and wild on the other, and the asymmetry made her look younger, more vulnerable, more like the girl who had arrived at the stones with a guidebook and less like the girl who had ten million people watching her. She pulled the sheet up. Not dramatically, not in modesty — just the small, unconscious adjustment of a person who had woken up in a place that wasn't her place and was calibrating.

"My parents," she said.

"They won't notice. They never notice."

"My parents."

He heard the difference. Not his parents. Hers. George, who narrated the apocalypse and noticed everything except what he narrated over. Rosemary, who cleaned things that were already clean and watched the door as though she didn't know what she was watching for. Neither of them had noticed the window opening at midnight. But the window had been designed for returning to — the ground-floor sill, the side yard, the easy geometry of a girl going out and coming back. The geometry of a girl not coming back was different, and the difference had a morning in it, and the morning was here.

"I should go," she said.

"Okay." He said it carefully. Not with reluctance — not with the pull of someone trying to keep her there — but with the measured neutrality of someone who understood that the morning after required a different architecture than the night before. He was being careful. He was being the best version of himself. The Emissary doing what the Emissary did: managing the moment, reading the room, presenting the response most likely to produce the desired outcome.

"Okay," she echoed. She didn't move.

The loop station hummed. The sheep choir murmured from the monitors. Six months of midnight sessions had ended here — in this bed, in this light, in this silence between two people who had crossed a line and hadn't yet decided what was on the other side.

She looked at him. The pale green eyes, serious, carrying something he could see but couldn't parse. Something underneath the surface that hadn't been there before — or had been there and he couldn't see it, or had been there and he'd filed it under *creative intensity* or *artistic temperament* or any of the classifications that allowed him to observe her without understanding her.

"Sergey," she said.

"Yeah."

She didn't say the next thing. Whatever she was carrying — whatever had moved behind her eyes when she woke up, whatever was sitting in the space between her mouth and the words she wasn't saying — stayed where it was. She looked at him for a long moment, the kind of moment that in a movie would have been followed by a confession or a kiss or a declaration, and in this bedroom in Beaverton was followed by Persephone Minton getting out of bed and finding her shoes.

She dressed with her back to him. He watched her — the line of her spine, the golden brown skin disappearing under fabric, the curls falling over her collar — and the watching was tender in a way that surprised him. He was not usually a tender person. Careful, yes. Precise, yes. Attentive in the way of someone who cataloged details the way a librarian cataloged books — comprehensively, systematically, without much emotional investment in the content. But the tenderness he felt watching her tie her shoes was something else. Something the system hadn't produced before. Something that arrived from the place below the notebook, the place where music lived, the place the Emissary couldn't reach.

"I'll text you," she said, from the door.

"Yeah."

She left. The way she always left — through the door, down the stairs, past the parents who slept the deep sleep of academics, out the side door into the morning. He heard her footsteps on the stairs. He heard the side door open and close. He heard the silence she left behind, which was different from the silence before she'd arrived, the way a room sounds different after music has been in it.

He lay in the bed that smelled like her shampoo and he stared at the blue ceiling and the staring felt like the beginning of something.

---

He decided to tell Kathleen the same day.

He was sitting on the edge of the bed. The sheet was still warm. The monitors threw blue light across his knees and his phone sat on the desk, face-down, the black rectangle of a thing that hadn't been picked up yet. The decision arrived the way his best decisions arrived — not as a choice but as a conclusion, the last line of a proof that had been assembling itself since he woke up. He believed in integrity. Not abstractly — the way you believe in a theorem — but viscerally, the way you believe in gravity. He knew that hiding this from Kathleen would be the Emissary's worst instinct — the instinct to manage, to control information, to keep the system running by concealing the data that would break it. He wouldn't do that. He was better than that. The boy who'd read about the Master and the Emissary, who'd understood — really understood, at a level deeper than the notebook — that the Emissary's great sin was the substitution of its own narrative for reality, that boy would not lie to Kathleen. He would tell her the truth. Because the truth was what you owed the people who trusted you.

He framed it this way in his head. The framing was flawless.

The decision felt clean. It felt like the hardest right over the easiest wrong. It felt like the kind of thing a person of integrity did — not confessing, exactly, because confession implied wrongdoing, and what had happened wasn't wrong. It was *something that happened.* He would tell Kathleen that something happened. He would present the new configuration. He would be honest, and the honesty would hurt, and the hurting would be the price of the truth, and the price was worth paying because the alternative was a lie and he was not a liar.

He picked up his phone. He opened FaceTime. He pressed Kathleen's name.

---

She answered the way she always answered.

The face that filled his screen was the face that had filled his screen for three years — round, open, those big eyes already bright before the connection fully resolved, the smile arriving before the pixels did. The face of a girl who answered her boyfriend's calls with what looked like the uncomplicated joy of someone who had never been given a reason not to. Her bedroom behind her — the lockdown bedroom, the one he'd seen in a thousand FaceTime calls, the posters and the lamp her parents had bought her and the bedspread that was always slightly rumpled and the normalness of it, the relentless, heartbreaking normalness of a girl's room that was just a room, not a studio, not a production space, just the four walls of a life being lived without an audience.

"Hey, babe." The warmth of her voice arriving through the speaker. The sound of someone who was always glad to hear from him. The sound of what he'd always taken for gladness itself — unperformed, unrehearsed, as automatic and as real as a heartbeat.

He looked at her face on the screen and the looking was, for the first time, difficult. Not because of guilt — he didn't feel guilty, which was itself a thing he might have examined if the Emissary examined its own architecture. The difficulty was simpler than guilt. The difficulty was that she was smiling at him and he was about to make her stop.

"I need to tell you something," he said.

Her face changed. Not dramatically — a micro-shift, her brow tightening, her eyes going fractionally wider. The shift was small enough that most people would have missed it. Sergey didn't miss things. He watched the shift happen and he cataloged it — *anticipatory anxiety response, limbic system activation prior to cognitive processing of threat* — and the cataloging was the thing he did instead of feeling what he was seeing, which was: a girl recognizing the shape of a sentence that had never preceded good news.

"Okay," she said. The warmth was still there but thinner, the way a voice thins when the throat tightens. "What's up?"

He told her.

"Persephone and I — something happened. Last night. It's been building for a while and I think — I think we both felt it." He paused. The pause was not for effect — it was the Emissary checking the architecture, making sure the next sentence was load-bearing. "I'm telling you because I respect you too much to lie about it."

He said *I respect you too much to lie* and he meant it. Every word. The Emissary's presentation was sincere in the way that the Emissary's presentations were always sincere — internally consistent, structurally sound, built on premises that followed logically from the premises before them. He respected Kathleen. He did not want to lie. Therefore he was telling the truth. The syllogism was clean. The conclusion was defensible. He believed every word.

---

The face on the screen went quiet.

Not the quiet of processing. Not the quiet of someone composing a response. Something else — something Sergey had never seen on Kathleen's face, which he'd been watching for three years, which he could catalog from memory: the smile (warm, prompt, reliable), the laugh (generous, immediate, the kind that made you want to be funnier), the concern (eyebrows pulling together, lower lip caught between teeth, the physical vocabulary of a girl who worried about people the way other people worried about weather — constantly, involuntarily, with total investment in the outcome). He'd seen all of her expressions. He'd cataloged the full range. He thought he had the complete dataset.

This was not in the dataset.

Her face went still. The round face, the wide eyes, the girl who said *that's amazing, babe* with exclamation marks that never wavered — went still in a way that was not any of the stillnesses he knew. Not the stillness of attention. Not the stillness of listening. Not even the stillness of hurt, which he'd seen once or twice when she'd come to school with her eyes red and her parents' voices still echoing in her face. This was a different thing. The stillness of a door becoming a wall. The stillness of something that had been open — had been open for three years, had been open since the first time she'd looked at him with those eyes and decided he was worth looking at — closing. Not slamming. Closing the way a stone settles. Quietly, completely, and with the specific permanence of a thing that would not be moved again.

She looked at him through the screen. Her eyes. The same eyes that had watched him play "Enough to See By" and heard something beautiful and missed the yurt. The same eyes that had watched Persephone's TikToks and said *perfect* and held the phone and bounced on the bed when the numbers climbed. The same eyes that had looked at him in England and chosen him and stayed and stayed and stayed.

She said something. Something small. He heard the words but couldn't fully hear them — the way you could see a building collapse on a screen but couldn't feel the ground shake. Whatever she said, it wasn't loud. It wasn't a question. It was the shortest sentence she had ever spoken to him — shorter than *that's beautiful, babe,* shorter than *shh,* shorter than anything she'd said in three years of exclamation marks and patience and a playlist with twelve listeners.

She hung up.

The screen went dark. His own face reflected in the glass — the high hairline, the skinny bones, the blue light of the monitors behind him. The Emissary's face in the Emissary's color in the room where everything had happened and was still happening and would keep happening even after the screen went dark. He held the phone and he felt — what? Something he could almost classify. Not guilt, exactly. Something more like the sensation of a structure behaving unexpectedly. He had modeled her response. He had run the scenarios — tears (probable), anger (possible), questions (expected). He had prepared for all of these. He had architecture for tears, for anger, for the conversation that would follow the conversation, for the processing and the pain and eventually — he was certain of this, the way the Emissary was certain of things, categorically, structurally — the acceptance. He had prepared for everything.

He had not prepared for quiet.

The quiet was outside the model. The quiet was the thing the Emissary couldn't classify because the Emissary classified through language and the quiet was the absence of language. The quiet was the sound of a girl who had used more exclamation marks in three years than most people used in a lifetime suddenly using none.

He texted Persephone. Three words.

*I told Kathleen.*

The text sat on the screen. The period at the end. The three words that looked like the last line of a proof — the thing to be demonstrated had been demonstrated. Q.E.D. The old configuration acknowledged. The new one ready to begin.

He put the phone down. He looked at the loop station. "Stone-HENGE" was still loaded — the display showing the track name in the small blue letters, the sheep choir still in the machine, the song that had broken the triangle still humming in the hardware, ready to play, ready to sing the story of a sheep who gained a name, to an audience that was now one person fewer.

---

The first thing he noticed was the absence of texts.

Not the content of the texts — the *existence* of them. Kathleen texted every day. Multiple times a day. The texts had been consistent the way weather was consistent — you stopped noticing them because they were always there, the way you stopped noticing the hum of a refrigerator or the pressure of the atmosphere. They were the ambient condition of his life. Good morning texts that arrived between 7:15 and 7:30 with the regularity of a system clock. Song-reaction texts — she listened to everything he posted, and the reaction arrived within hours, always warm, always specific enough to prove she'd listened and general enough to prove she hadn't heard the yurt. Selfies in her lockdown bedroom with bored expressions and silly filters — the duck face, the dog ears, the one that made your eyes enormous which was redundant on Kathleen because her eyes were already enormous. "How's the new track?" "Miss you babe." "Tell Persephone I said hi!"

The exclamation marks. Always the exclamation marks. The punctuation of a girl who experienced enthusiasm as a primary emotion, who found things amazing and said so, who ended sentences the way she ended phone calls — with an upward inflection, an opening, a small sonic door left ajar for the other person to walk through. The exclamation marks were her signature. They were the most consistent thing in his life, more consistent than his own creative output, more reliable than the numbers on the Spotify dashboard. Kathleen's exclamation marks. The faithful punctuation of someone who loved him with the kind of love that punctuated itself.

They stopped.

Not gradually. Not trailing off — not the slow diminishment of a signal losing strength, not the fade-out at the end of a track where the sound gets softer and softer until you're not sure if you're still hearing it or just remembering it. They stopped the way a heartbeat stops. One moment present. The next moment the most noticeable absence in the world. He woke up the first morning and there was no good morning text and the phone looked wrong without it — the screen empty where a message should have been, like a face missing a feature. Not a deformity. A subtraction. Something taken from a thing that used to be complete.

He texted her. *Hey.* No response.

He texted again the next day. *Can we talk?* No response.

He tried calling. FaceTime. The sound it made — the double tone, ascending, repeating, the sound of a connection being attempted and not completed — was the loneliest sound he had ever heard. Lonelier than his music. Lonelier than the twenty people in a room who were all him. Because the ringing was a sound designed for two people, a sound that existed only in the space between a caller and a receiver, and one of them wasn't there. The ringing was a bridge with a missing end. The ringing was his voice traveling through the air toward a phone in a bedroom across town, and the air carried nothing back, and the nothing arrived in his room as a series of ascending tones that meant *nobody is here.*

In lockdown, vanishing required no logistics. You didn't need to move, transfer, pack boxes, change cities. You didn't need to make a scene. You just stopped answering. The screen that had connected you became the wall that sealed you off, and the wall was perfect — no cracks, no gaps, no place to press your ear and hear what was on the other side. Digital absence was the purest form of absence. Physical absence left traces — an empty chair, a gap in a row, a cleared locker. Digital absence left nothing. The screen looked the same whether someone was choosing not to respond or had simply ceased to exist. The pixels didn't care. The interface didn't grieve.

Her Instagram stopped updating. The last post was from before the FaceTime call — a sunset photo from her bedroom window, the sky going orange and purple over the rooftops of whatever Beaverton street her sealed house faced, captioned with a single line. No exclamation marks. No hearts. No tags. Just five words in the tone of someone who had already started leaving:

*the view from here.*

Sergey looked at the post on his phone and the five words landed with a weight that his taxonomy struggled to hold. *The view from here.* He read the *here* the way the Emissary read everything — as a variable requiring definition. Here being her bedroom. Here being lockdown. Here being the place she'd been sealed inside by parents who checked the doors while her best friend and her boyfriend crossed a line in a room she couldn't reach. He could see the frame: the rooftops, the light, the caption that said nothing and held everything. What the view looked like from her side — what *here* meant to the girl looking out the window — he couldn't access. The five words sat on his screen and he read them and the reading was his and the *here* was hers and the distance between those two things was the distance the Emissary could not cross.

He didn't understand it. He could describe it — *withdrawal behavior, avoidant coping mechanism, the cessation of contact as a self-protective response to interpersonal betrayal* — and the description was accurate the way a blueprint was accurate, all the measurements correct and none of the feeling. He could see the what. He couldn't access the why. Or he could access a version of the why — *she's hurt, I hurt her, the information I provided caused an emotional response she is managing through avoidance* — but the version was the Emissary's version, the version that kept him at the center of the narrative, the version in which Kathleen's disappearance was a response to his action rather than an action of her own.

He could have asked whether her silence was about him or about her. He didn't ask. The question lived at the edge of his framework, in the place where the map ended, and the Emissary did not travel past the edge of the map.

---

Days passed. The days in lockdown passed the way they always passed — shapeless, identical, each one a copy of the one before, the kind of days that dissolved into weeks before you noticed the dissolving. Except now the days had a new absence in them, and the absence had a shape, and the shape was Kathleen.

He felt something about this that he could not name. He sat at his desk and the loop station glowed and his phone lay dark on the surface beside his hand — the phone that used to light up between 7:15 and 7:30 and now lit up only when Persephone texted, which was different, which was what he'd wanted, which was fine.

The Emissary had categories for most things. Guilt. Regret. Loss. Relief. Sorrow. The taxonomy of negative affect was extensive, refined over years of self-observation, and none of the categories fit precisely. The feeling was not guilt — not the sharp, specific guilt of a person who had done something wrong and knew it. The feeling was not regret — not the backward-looking ache of someone who wished they'd chosen differently. The feeling was something else. Something that lived in the gap between the categories, in the place where the classification system broke down, in the space where the Emissary's map didn't match the territory.

What he felt was the specific discomfort of a system that had achieved its stated objective and produced an outcome the system didn't model. He had told Kathleen the truth. He had been honest. He had been respectful. He had done the honorable thing, the courageous thing, the thing the boy who'd read McGilchrist would do. And the result was a girl who had disappeared — not into anger or grief or any of the responses he'd prepared for, but into silence, and the silence was a room he couldn't enter and couldn't see into and the room was somewhere on the other side of town where a girl was doing something with her devastation that didn't involve him.

He got what he wanted. The cost was a person.

He should feel worse than he did. He knew this. The knowledge that he should feel worse was itself a feeling — a meta-guilt, a guilt about insufficient guilt, the Emissary observing its own inadequate emotional response and classifying the inadequacy as a data point. He filed it. He noted it. He moved on. Because Persephone was in his bed now. Persephone texted him back. Persephone was the revised model, the updated configuration, the thing the system had always been pointed toward, and the thing the system had given up to get there was already becoming an absence he would learn to live inside — the way you learned to live inside any room with a missing wall. By not looking at the gap.

---

Weeks passed. The lockdown eased and tightened and eased again — the world opening in increments, the rules shifting, the streets slowly repopulating with people who walked like they weren't sure the ground would hold them. School came back in a limited form — hybrid, staggered, masks and distance and the specific strangeness of seeing faces you'd been watching on a screen for six months suddenly occupying three-dimensional space. Everything looked wrong in person. Everyone looked smaller.

Kathleen's locker was empty.

He saw it on the first day back. He was walking down the hallway — the hallway that smelled the same, disinfectant and floor wax and the faint biological hum of a building designed to hold a thousand teenagers — and he passed the row of lockers near the science wing and hers was shut. Not locked. Shut. The kind of shut that didn't have anything behind it. He couldn't have explained how he knew this — the locker looked the same as every other closed locker in the hallway, same grey metal, same combination dial, same scuffed surface — but he knew. The locker was empty the way her Instagram was empty, the way his phone was empty of her name, the way the absence had a density he could feel even through a metal door.

He asked someone. He didn't want to ask someone — the asking was a concession, an acknowledgment that the information he needed was not available through his own observation — but the data was insufficient. A kid from AP Chem, a boy whose name Sergey had cataloged and never used, said: "Kathleen? I think she transferred. Or went online full-time. I don't know, man. She just stopped coming."

She just stopped coming. She just stopped texting. She just stopped posting. She just stopped. The consistency of the stopping was its own data — not a gradual withdrawal, not a selective retreat, but a complete cessation. All frequencies. All channels. The girl who had been the most reliable signal in his life had gone dark, and the darkness was total, and the totality suggested something the Emissary could classify but not feel: this was not temporary. This was not a pause. This was not a response he could wait out, manage through, process toward resolution. This was a girl leaving. The way a cat leaves — not with an announcement, not with a confrontation, but through the back lane in the dark, the half moon whispering *go,* the departure already complete before anyone noticed it had begun.

Virtue the Cat didn't explain her departure. She just departed. And the sound someone found for her — her name, her identity — was the thing she lost on the way out. Kathleen, who had been *babe* and *the supportive one* and *the girl who held the phone* and *my boyfriend is a genius ❤️* — Kathleen, who had been all of these things and none of the things he'd needed her to be — slipped out the back lane and took nothing with her except the silence where the exclamation marks had been.

---

Persephone was in his studio.

She was there most nights now — the walk through the streets, the side door, the stairs, the blue light — but the *there* had changed. Before, she sat on the bed and they worked. She listened to tracks. She said things that reorganized his understanding of his own music. She sat cross-legged against the wall in the position Kathleen used to occupy and the echo was there — they both felt it, he thought — and the echo was a thing they navigated around the way you navigated around a piece of furniture that had been left by a previous tenant. You didn't move it. You didn't acknowledge it. You just walked around it and eventually the walking-around became the route and the route felt normal and the furniture was still there and nobody mentioned it.

Now she sat on the bed and they were *together* — together the way a word changes when you italicize it, the same word with a different weight — and the togetherness changed the air in the room. The music continued. The Instagram strategy continued. She still said things that cut through his framework with a single sentence. He still built structures for her instinctive voice. The creative partnership was the same partnership, functioning the same way, producing the same results, except now the partnership also included her body next to his in the dark and his hand on her hip and the specific, physical fact of a relationship that had crossed from one category into another.

But something was different, and the difference was hard to name.

She was quieter. Not Kathleen-quiet — not the devastating, total quiet of a thing ending. A different quiet. The quiet of a person carrying something heavy and not mentioning the weight. She still laughed. She still made observations that arrived at his destination before he did. She still noticed things — the new cable, the adjusted mic position, the track that needed the gap in the third measure. But underneath the noticing, underneath the laughter, underneath the surface of the girl who was brilliant and present and his — there was a layer. Something underneath. A current running below the conversation, audible in the pauses between her sentences, visible in the moments when her eyes went to a middle distance that wasn't looking at anything in his room.

He could detect the current. He couldn't diagnose it.

She flinched when Kathleen's name came up. Not physically — not a visible recoil, not a turning away. Something behind her eyes. A micro-shift. The green going fractionally darker — or that was how he perceived it, the Emissary translating an emotional register into a visual metaphor because the emotion itself was unreadable. He cataloged the flinch. He didn't understand it.

He thought she felt guilty. He imagined the guilt of choosing one person over another — the clean guilt, the binary guilt, the guilt of a decision made and its consequences accepted. He thought he understood. He cataloged the flinch and built a framework around it and the framework fit and he didn't look too closely at the fit. The framework said: she chose me. The framework had *choice.* The framework had *mutual.* The framework had *it was building for a long time.* And the fit was clean, and the cleanliness was reassuring, and he held the reassurance the way you hold a key that opens every door — confidently, without checking whether the doors led where you thought they led.

He was gentle with her about Kathleen. When the name came up — rarely, glancingly, the way you mention someone who has left a room — he said things that were meant to be comforting. "She'll be okay." "She just needs time." "It's a lot to process." The sentences were reasonable. They were the kind of sentences a thoughtful person says when someone they care about is hurt. The sentences landed, and Persephone received them, and her face did nothing he could read.

*She'll be okay.* He didn't know if she'd be okay. He needed to believe she'd be okay because the alternative — that she wouldn't be, that the thing he'd done had damaged something that couldn't be repaired, that the girl with the exclamation marks was somewhere across town learning to live without exclamation marks and the learning was the saddest kind of learning — made him the villain. And the Emissary could not be the villain of his own story. The narrative required a role for Sergey, and the role was: the boy who was honest. The boy who told the truth. The boy who respected her too much to lie. The role was not: the boy who broke her. The role was never that.

The bigger narratives — the frameworks he didn't say out loud — lived in his head the way his best lyrics lived in his head before he let them out. *It was going to happen eventually.* He thought this. He didn't say it. *We couldn't keep pretending.* He thought this too. He kept the frameworks internal because somewhere, in a place the Emissary couldn't fully access, he knew that if he said *it was going to happen eventually* Persephone would look at him in a way that broke the model. He knew that *we couldn't keep pretending* required a *we* she hadn't offered. The frameworks stayed private — the Emissary's analgesic, self-administered, never tested against the other person's reality.

He believed them. He needed to believe them. The alternative — that what happened wasn't inevitable, wasn't mutual, wasn't a long-awaited revelation but a misread that destroyed a girl who had done nothing wrong except love him with exclamation marks and hold a phone and stay — was outside the model.

And outside the model was where the Emissary could not go.

Something specific he noticed.

Persephone stopped doing the Sheepey voice.

Not all at once — not the way Kathleen's texts stopped, abruptly and completely. More like a fade. A diminishment. Days went by without the posh accent, without the dignified complaints about modernity, without the drunk sheep's opinions about things no sheep should have opinions about. The character — the most vivid thing Persephone created, the purest expression of her gift for making the unreal real — went quiet.

He noticed the absence the way he noticed all absences — as data, as a change in pattern, as a deviation from the baseline he'd unconsciously established over months of midnight sessions where Sheepey appeared as regularly as the loops on the 505. The Sheepey bits were part of the rhythm of their creative nights. She'd be listening to a track and she'd slip into the voice — *"Rather a lot of bass, isn't it? He finds it somewhat indelicate"* — and the voice would crack them both up and the cracking-up was a release valve, a way of letting air into the intensity of the work, and now the valve wasn't opening.

Tuesday. She was listening to a rough mix of "Inventory" and the second verse had a bass line that wobbled like something drunk and he waited — waited for the posh voice to arrive, for the dignified complaint — and it didn't come. She just said "the bass wobbles" and kept listening. He noted it the way he noted everything. He filed it.

He read it the way the Emissary read everything — through the framework of progress, of development, of the narrative that moved from simpler to more complex, from child to adult, from the old self to the new. Persephone was growing up. That was his reading. She was maturing past the character, leaving the childish thing behind as the adult thing began. Sheepey was the girl's toy; the woman didn't need it. The reading was clean. The reading was structurally sound. The reading was the kind of thing a smart boy who had read too much McGilchrist might think about a girl who had stopped doing a funny voice.

He didn't consider that Sheepey had always been a conversation — that the voice he'd noticed wasn't a solo but a duet. *"He finds the mule rather common."* *"The goat farmer had land."* The back-and-forth, the call-and-response, the timing that required someone to play against. He didn't consider that the someone was gone, and that the gone-ness might be the silence, and that the silence might not be growth at all but the sound of a duet with a missing voice.

He didn't consider this. He built another track instead.

Late October. The room. The blue light. The loop station loaded with something new — not "Stone-HENGE," not anymore, the sheep choir filed and moved on, replaced by a track called "The View From" that he'd written in three hours and didn't want to examine too closely because examining it would have meant acknowledging that the title came from Kathleen's last Instagram post and the acknowledgment would have broken the narrative that said *she'll be okay.*

Persephone was on the bed. Cross-legged. Back against the wall. The position she always took. His laptop was open between them, her latest Instagram video queued for review — a riff about the strangeness of going back to school in masks, the way everyone looked like a stranger and a neighbor simultaneously, the way a half-face was harder to read than a whole one. She'd recorded it that afternoon. The video was good. She knew it was good. He knew it was good. The conversation about whether it was good was unnecessary, and they had it anyway, because the conversation was the architecture and the architecture was the relationship and the relationship needed the architecture now more than ever because without it they were just two people in a room who had done something they hadn't processed.

"The ending needs a button," he said. "You trail off. Don't trail off. End it."

"I like the trail."

"The trail sounds like you're looking for approval. You don't look for approval. You arrive."

She considered this. She tilted her head — the same tilt she'd given his music, the angle of someone hearing something they wanted to hear again — and the tilt was the same and the context was different and he felt the difference and the difference was warm and complicated and not entirely comfortable.

"Okay," she said. "One take. If it's worse, we keep the trail."

"Deal."

She picked up her phone. She positioned it on the stack of books that served as a tripod — the same setup, the same angle, the same technology of a girl talking to a camera from a boy's bedroom instead of her own. The fairy lights were absent. The blue glow replaced the red-gold. She was in his territory now, his color, his wavelength, and the video she recorded would carry his light even if the audience couldn't see it.

She recorded the take. One take. The ending was a full stop instead of a trail — the observation about half-faces landing and staying, no uptick, no looking for permission, just the sentence and then her face and then the cut. She played it back.

"Better," she said.

"Better."

She put the phone down. She looked at him. The pale green eyes. The layer underneath the surface — the current he could detect and couldn't diagnose, the thing she carried and didn't mention.

"Sergey," she said.

"Yeah."

"Have you heard from Kathleen?"

The name in the room. The name that flinched her. The name that meant a locker and a silence and an Instagram account that hadn't posted since *the view from here.* He felt the name land between them the way a stone lands in water — the impact, then the ripples, then the settling.

"No," he said.

She nodded. She didn't say anything else. She didn't ask the follow-up — *did you try, how many times, what did you say, what happened when she didn't answer* — the follow-up that would have required him to describe the ringing phone and the empty locker and the texts that went out and never came back. He suspected he knew why — that asking would have meant naming the thing neither of them was naming, and the not-naming was the only architecture holding the room together.

He said: "She'll be okay."

The words came out before he could check them, the way the first loop came out before the architecture was ready — instinctive, unstructured, the Emissary reaching for the nearest framework because the silence needed filling and the framework was what the Emissary used to fill silences. *She'll be okay.* The analgesic. The label. The classification applied to a thing he couldn't see, spoken into the space between them where it sat, unabsorbed, like a stone dropped into water too shallow to swallow it.

Persephone looked at him. The green eyes. The layer. The current.

She didn't say anything. She picked up her phone and watched the video again. And the not-saying was louder than the saying, and the loudness was in the space between them, and the space was the gap, and the gap was where Kathleen used to be.

---

He built a track that night, after she left.

The loop station. The pedal. Click. The first loop — a low pulse, something that lived in the bass register and didn't announce itself, something that sat underneath the architecture like a foundation nobody would see. Second layer — a processed vocal, his voice pitched down and stretched until it sounded like someone speaking from the bottom of a well, the words indistinct, the tone carrying everything the words didn't. Third layer — silence. Literal silence, recorded, looped. Four bars of nothing, cycling through the track like a held breath, like a gap in a rhythm where a hit should have been, like the space where an exclamation mark used to be.

The track built itself the way the good ones built themselves now — not from the top down, not from the framework to the feeling, but from the place below the notebook, the place the Emissary couldn't reach, the place that had been growing since England and was now, in the weeks after the triangle broke, larger than it had ever been. The music came from the gap. The gap was where the feeling lived. And the feeling, tonight, had a shape he hadn't felt before — not the yurt, not the castle, not the couch in Southampton. Something newer. Something that tasted like the room with the missing wall.

He built and he listened and the listening was the Emissary's version of feeling — the analytical attention turned inward, the system monitoring its own output, checking for flaws, looking for the places where the architecture had failed. And the architecture had not failed. The track was good. The track was as good as anything he'd made. The pulse was steady, the vocal wash was warm, the looped silence was the most devastating thing in it — four bars of nothing that said more than any lyric because the nothing was *specific* nothing, the nothing of a particular absence, the nothing that had a name and a round face and wide brown eyes and exclamation marks.

He didn't name the track. He saved it without a title. He saved it in the folder where the unnamed things lived — the sketches, the fragments, the sounds that hadn't yet been given the architecture of a song. He saved it and he closed the laptop and the room went dark except for the loop station, five colored buttons glowing in a row, patient, ready, the machine that would build whatever he asked it to build and would never ask what it cost.

He sat in the dark. The room was quiet. The room smelled like her shampoo and like his cables and the two smells coexisted the way the two colors coexisted on her skin that first morning — the warmth and the blue, the Master and the Emissary, her presence in his territory. The sheet still carried the shape of where she'd been.

He thought about Kathleen. The thought arrived uninvited, the way the best lyrics arrived — from below the notebook, from the place the system couldn't manage. He thought about her face on the FaceTime screen in the moment before it closed. The door becoming the wall. The stillness he'd never seen before and would never see again because the seeing required proximity and the proximity was gone and Kathleen was somewhere on the other side of town in a sealed house with strict parents and a bedroom that was just a bedroom, and the girl in the bedroom was doing something with her silence that he would never know about because he was in his room, in his light, with his loop station and his revised model and the girl who was the revision.

The thought was there, and it was uncomfortable, and the discomfort was the faintest awareness that something was wrong with the model. Not wrong enough to rebuild. Not wrong enough to dismantle the framework and start over, to re-examine the premises, to consider the possibility that *she chose me* was not what happened. Just wrong enough to notice. A draft in a room where a wall used to be. A coolness moving across his face from a direction he couldn't identify. A wind.

He sat with it. He didn't name it. He didn't classify it.

For once — for the first time, maybe, since the system had learned to classify — the Emissary let a feeling sit without a label. The feeling was there. The feeling had a shape. The shape was a girl who was gone and a girl who was here and a boy in between who had done the right thing and the right thing was wrong and the wrongness was a draft and the draft was a wind and the wind was outside, in the streets, in the trees that were turning, in the world that was moving while he sat in his blue room with his glowing machine and his unnamed track and his updated model.

The loop station hummed. The colored buttons glowed. Somewhere across town, a phone rang in an empty room.

Nobody answered.

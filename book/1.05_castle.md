The stove was ticking and Kathleen was breathing beside her and Persefoni was not asleep.

She'd been lying here a while — long enough for the yurt to settle into its nighttime sounds, the canvas walls shifting in the wind like something alive, the wood stove clicking as the metal cooled and warmed and cooled again. Kathleen's breathing beside her was slow and even — had been for twenty minutes, maybe longer. She'd wound down mid-Sheepey bit — "He finds the mule rather common, but respects his commitment to the tunnel" — and her voice had gotten slower and her body had gotten heavier against Persefoni's side and then the breathing had gone deep and regular and that was Kathleen, asleep the way Kathleen always fell asleep, like someone had turned her off at the wall.

Across the gap, Alejandro was quiet. She didn't know if he was asleep. She didn't think so. He had the particular silence of someone thinking too hard to sleep — a silence that was different from unconsciousness the way a held breath is different from no breath at all.

She was thinking about what he'd said on the stone wall. The king and the servant. The Master locked in the tower. She didn't have his words for it — she wouldn't say "lateralization" or "phenomenological" or any of the other words he reached for when an idea was too big for his hands — but she had the picture. A quiet king who saw everything. A loud servant who labeled everything. The servant taking over, running the kingdom, so certain he was in charge that he forgot there had ever been a real king at all. And the thing she'd said — *why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it* — she'd seen it land on his face like a stone dropped into still water, the circles spreading outward, and she'd known she'd said something that mattered. But she couldn't hold it. The match lit and went out. She was lying in the dark trying to remember what she'd seen by its light.

She was also thinking about Alejandro.

Not the way he thought about her — she didn't know how he thought about her, not really, though she knew he watched her, and she knew the watching meant something she'd decided not to examine. She was thinking about the way he'd talked today. The way his face had opened up when he was explaining the hemispheres — that thing it did, the transformation, the kid in the corduroy blazer suddenly becoming the most alive thing in the room, his eyes bright and his hands moving like they were trying to shape something his mouth couldn't quite hold.

And his music. God, his music.

She and Kathleen were & Amateur Cartography's biggest fans. Not performatively — not as girlfriend-and-girlfriend's-best-friend doing their supportive duty — but genuinely, completely, the way you're a fan of something when it reaches inside you and rearranges the furniture without asking. The song about the man who builds a house out of his own memories and then can't find the door — she'd listened to that one alone in her room, in the dark, headphones on, lying on her bed staring at the ceiling, and felt like someone had broken into her chest and described what they found there in a language she didn't know existed. The one about the woman who teaches a river to speak and then can't make it stop talking — Kathleen had cried the first time she heard it, actual tears rolling down her round face, and Persefoni had to look away so Kathleen wouldn't see that she was crying too.

They talked about his songs the way they talked about Sheepey — building on each other, finishing each other's sentences, riffing. Except with the songs they weren't joking. They meant it. They thought he was the best musician they'd ever heard, and they'd told him this, and he never believed them, because Alejandro couldn't believe anything that wasn't delivered in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article with a sample size he approved of.

It had started with The Weakerthans.

Alejandro had played them "Virtue the Cat Explains Her Departure" one afternoon in his room — the three of them on the floor, Kathleen leaning against his bed, Persefoni cross-legged by the bookshelf, Alejandro at his laptop finding the track with the careful precision of a person about to show you something important. A song about a cat who'd left home. She was out in the world now, living among ferals and pigeons, and she was trying to remember the sound her owner used to make for her. The sound that was her name. The thing that made her *her.* And she couldn't. *I can't remember the sound that you found for me.* The cat's whole identity — the word someone had loved her with — was gone.

Kathleen thought it was cute. "Aww, the cat song," she'd said, and she'd scratched an imaginary cat behind its ears and smiled. It looked warm. It always looked warm with Kathleen.

Persefoni couldn't speak.

She sat on the floor of Alejandro's room and the song ended and she didn't move. It wasn't cute. It was the most devastating thing she'd ever heard. A cat who'd lost her name. A cat whose whole self was a sound someone else had made, and when she left, the sound left with her, or she left the sound behind, and now she was just an animal in a back lane who used to be someone's. Persefoni felt it in her chest like a hand closing — not sadness exactly, something bigger, something she didn't have a name for, which was the whole point: the cat didn't have a name for it either. That was what the song was about. Losing the name. Not knowing you'd lost it until you tried to remember it and found the place where it used to be was empty.

She'd made him play it again. And again.

And then she'd gone looking on her own and found the prequel — "Plea from a Cat Named Virtue" — where the cat was still home, still with her owner, and the owner was depressed, barely alive, sleeping all day, and the cat was *begging* him to get up. To open the house. To invite people in. To let her help. *I'll lie down and lick the sorrow from your skin / scratch the terror and begin / to believe you're strong.* The cat loved this man so completely that her whole plea was just: be alive. Be here. Let me in. And in the departure song — the one Alejandro had played first — you learned that the cat left anyway. The love wasn't enough. She left and lost the sound and the love wasn't enough to make her stay.

The cat was doing what Persefoni did. A creature who shouldn't be able to say those things, saying them anyway, and meaning them more than any person could. Virtue was Sheepey. Virtue was what she'd been doing since she was seven years old — building a character and letting the character say the true thing. Except Virtue wasn't funny. Virtue was the version of the thing that broke your heart.

And Kathleen had thought it was cute.

That gap — between what Persefoni heard in the song and what Kathleen heard — was a gap she'd never noticed before and couldn't stop noticing after. It wasn't a flaw in Kathleen. It wasn't even a difference she could name. It was just — Kathleen heard a song about a cat, and Persefoni heard a song about losing the word someone loved you with, and they were both right, and the distance between those two ways of hearing was six feet wide.

The same width as the gap between two beds in a yurt.

Alejandro had named his band after a line from another Weakerthans song — "Aside." *Armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography.* He'd kept the second half of the line and stuck an ampersand in front of it, because of course he had — he was the kind of person who named things after the part nobody quoted and expected you to follow the reference. But she understood why he'd chosen it. The precious failures. The maps that were wrong but you kept them anyway because the trying mattered. She'd seen his notebooks — the pages of crossed-out lyrics, the arrows connecting ideas that didn't quite connect, the margins full of second tries. Amateur cartography. Maps of a territory he could feel but couldn't draw.

His music was where she found him beautiful. Not beautiful the way she meant it when she looked at a boy and something moved in her stomach and her skin felt different — not that. Beautiful the way a voice in the dark is beautiful, the way a sentence you've never heard before can stop you mid-step on a sidewalk. His music was where the careful boy disappeared and something wilder came through, and in that place he was extraordinary, and she knew this, and she admired it with something that was very close to love and was not love, or not the kind that went anywhere, or not the kind she understood yet.

But then she thought about *him.* Him — the body. The curly-haired kid in the corduroy blazer who forgot to eat lunch and had to be reminded to stand up straight. He was taller than her — the right height, the right build, the kind of boy who should have been her type on paper. But the body did nothing for her. The curly hair that mirrored her own in a way that felt more like a sibling echo than anything romantic.

She felt nothing.

A fondness. The kind of warmth you feel for a cousin who makes you laugh, or a very clever dog who does a trick that impresses you. She could look at Alejandro and feel absolutely nothing below the neck. Her body had not been consulted and had nothing to say. She knew this with a certainty that required no examination.

The stove ticked. The wind moved through the canvas walls. Across the gap, Alejandro's silence continued — that held-breath quiet, that thinking-too-hard-to-sleep silence. She could feel it the way you feel weather changing. And Kathleen was warm beside her, breathing slow and even, and the yurt was dark and the festival was quiet outside and Persefoni was thinking about a cat who couldn't remember her own name when the comforter shifted.

---

The warmth beside her moved.

Kathleen's body — the body that had been pressed against hers for the last twenty minutes, the familiar weight and heat of her best friend asleep — lifted away, and the cold rushed into the space she'd left, and Persefoni felt it before she understood it. The absence. The draft. The sudden wrong temperature at her back where Kathleen should have been.

But Kathleen was asleep. Kathleen had been asleep for —

Then Kathleen's feet on the fur rug. Small. Deliberate. *Not the movements of someone who had just woken up.* The sound of someone who knew exactly what she was doing — who had been lying there with her eyes closed and her breathing carefully slowed, performing sleep, waiting. For how long? Since the Sheepey bit? Since they'd gotten into bed? Persefoni's mind raced backward through the last twenty minutes — the even breathing, the heaviness, the perfect impression of unconsciousness — and landed on the fact that Kathleen had been awake the entire time. Beside her. Planning this. While Persefoni lay there thinking about Virtue the Cat and Alejandro's music and the king in the tower, Kathleen had been lying next to her running a countdown.

Persefoni's whole body went still. Not a decision. A reflex. The way an animal freezes when it hears a branch snap in the dark — every muscle locking, every breath suspended, the body making a choice the mind hasn't caught up to yet.

Kathleen had been building to this — the hand in the car that afternoon, sliding up Alejandro's thigh while she asked about yurts, the way she'd been looking at him all day, a new confidence in her body that Persefoni had recognized even if she hadn't named it. Kathleen had decided. Probably hours ago. Maybe days. She'd faked sleep so Persefoni wouldn't know. This was Kathleen deciding.

And Persefoni's first thought — the very first thing that moved through her, before fear, before embarrassment, before anything she could have predicted — was: *don't move. Don't breathe. If they know you're awake, Kathleen will die.*

Not literally. But the Kathleen who had crossed that gap with certainty, the Kathleen who was brave enough to do this — that girl would be destroyed by knowing her best friend had heard. The mortification alone would break something. And Persefoni loved Kathleen more than she loved sleep, more than she loved comfort, more than she loved the idea of not lying in the dark listening to her best friend have sex six feet behind her. So.

She didn't move.

She faced the stove. The cast iron was right there — close, warm, its glow falling directly on her face. Orange and flickering. It turned her skin gold, she supposed, though she couldn't see it. She could feel the heat on her cheeks, on her closed eyelids, on the curls that had fallen across her forehead. She was in the firelight. The warmth held her face the way a hand holds a face — gently, without asking, just there.

Behind her — on the other side of the yurt, on the side where Kathleen had gone, where the sounds were starting — darkness. No moonlight yet. Just the stove's glow on her face and the dark at her back. The warmth on her face. The nothing behind her. She was between them, and she was not going to turn around.

She pulled her breathing shallow and slow and she lay there and she heard — everything.

The bed. The soft compression of the mattress, the whisper of the comforter shifting, weight settling and resettling. The breathing — Kathleen's breathing, which had changed, which was different now from the sleeping-breathing of ten minutes ago, faster and shallower and doing something Persefoni had never heard it do before. The sounds that were not words. Small sounds. Private sounds. Sounds that belonged to a room with one fewer person in it.

Kathleen's voice saying his name.

Quiet. Almost not there. But Persefoni heard it the way you hear a pin drop in a silent room — not because it was loud but because everything else had gone quiet enough to let it through. His name. Said like it was the only word left. Said like it was a door she was walking through.

What Persefoni felt was not jealousy.

She turned this over carefully, the way you turn over a stone to see what's underneath, and what she found was: no. Not jealousy. She didn't want to be where Kathleen was. She didn't want Alejandro's hands on her. She didn't want his body or his bed or the space Kathleen was currently occupying. When she tried to imagine herself in Kathleen's place — tried to put herself in that bed, under those hands, with that boy — her imagination simply refused. It was like trying to picture a color that didn't exist. The want wasn't there.

What she felt was something she didn't have a word for. A feeling like watching a door close from the wrong side. She was losing something. Right now, in real time, lying in the dark with the stove-light on her face and the sounds behind her, something between the three of them was ending. The ease. The uncomplicated geometry where nobody was sleeping with anybody and Sheepey had a gambling problem and the worst thing in the world was her mom's pronunciation. That was over. She could hear it ending, and she was the only one listening, because the other two were busy ending it.

She thought: *Kathleen is happy.* She could hear it. The sounds Kathleen made — the breathing, the small gasps, the way she whispered his name — were the sounds of someone who was exactly where she wanted to be, with the person she wanted to be with. Kathleen was in love and Kathleen was brave and Kathleen had crossed that gap with the quiet certainty of a girl who seemed to have never once doubted that she was loved back. Persefoni admired this. Genuinely. Even as something in her chest was folding in on itself like a piece of paper being crumpled.

She thought: *Alejandro is quiet.*

Too quiet. She could hear Kathleen — every breath, every movement, the soft give of the mattress with each shift of weight — but she could barely hear him. He was — what? Passive? Silent? She couldn't see. She wouldn't turn over. But the absence on his side of it was its own kind of information. Kathleen was the one making sounds. Alejandro was the one receiving them. And the asymmetry told her something she filed away not in a drawer or a cabinet or a system but in her body, in the place where she kept things she knew but hadn't named yet. The growing collection.

The moonlight came in.

She saw it on the wall behind the stove — the canvas that had been dark, that the stove's glow never reached because the cast iron blocked its own light backward, suddenly brightening. Silver-blue, creeping down the fabric like water down a windowpane. The moon had found the ring at the top of the crown, and its light was pouring through the gap and falling into the yurt, and the wall she was staring at — the one surface in her field of vision that the fire couldn't touch — was turning cold and bright.

So she was between them. The stove's warmth on her face, close and orange, alive and flickering. The moon's light on the wall beyond it, silver and steady, arriving without being asked. And behind her — filling the rest of the yurt, falling on the bed where the sounds were coming from — more moonlight. She could feel it at her back. The whole space had shifted, cooled, gone blue, and the only warmth left was the small circle of firelight holding her face.

She was in the fire. They were in the moon.

And she was sixteen years old and her best friend was losing her virginity six feet behind her and the boy was someone she couldn't want and didn't want and somehow that made it worse, not better, because if she'd wanted him at least the feeling would have a name.

She held very still. She breathed very slowly. The sounds continued behind her — the bed, the breathing, Kathleen's small voice — and her arm was going numb. She'd been in the same position since Kathleen left the bed. Her shoulder was pressed into the mattress. Her hand was curled under the pillow. The numbness was spreading from her elbow to her fingertips and she couldn't move because if she moved they'd know. She held. She held. Her fingers tingled and then stopped tingling and then felt like they belonged to someone else.

And then she couldn't. The numbness won. The body overrode the will — a mutiny of nerves, a physical veto — and she shifted. Just her shoulder. Just resettling. The smallest movement she could make.

She felt eyes on her back.

She knew it instantly — the way you know, the way your body knows before your mind catches up. A pressure between her shoulder blades that had nothing to do with the mattress. He was looking at her. Right now. In the middle of it. He had opened his eyes and he was looking at her back and she could feel it the way you feel heat from a fire in a dark room — not seeing the source but knowing exactly where it was.

She went still. She stopped breathing. She didn't move again.

---

Silence.

The sounds stopped. The bed stopped creaking. The breathing behind her changed — Kathleen's, slowing, deepening, the long even rhythm of someone settling into the deepest kind of sleep, the kind that comes after. A body satisfied. A body done.

Persefoni waited.

A long time. She listened to the stove tick down, each tick farther from the last as the embers settled. She listened to the wind move through the canvas — that endless gentle motion, bending and releasing, never holding. She listened for Alejandro's breathing and couldn't find it, which meant he was still awake, or breathing so shallowly she couldn't hear, or holding still the way she was holding still, both of them lying in the dark pretending to be invisible.

She thought about a princess in a castle. She didn't know why — the image just came, the way images came to her, uninvited and fully formed. A girl in a stone room hearing things through the wall. A girl who couldn't move. A girl who lay there all night because someone she loved was on the other side and the walls were thick but not thick enough.

Then the image was gone. And she was just Persefoni in a yurt in Wales, awake, alone in the specific way you're alone when you're surrounded by people who don't know you're there.

---

She must have slept, because Kathleen was waking her up.

"Rise and shine!" Kathleen's voice, bright, close, a hand on her shoulder shaking gently. Persefoni opened her eyes and the yurt was full of morning light — white and clean through the canvas, turning everything pale. And Kathleen was beside her. In their bed. Under the comforter. As if she'd never left.

Persefoni's brain caught up in pieces. Kathleen had come back. At some point in the night — after Alejandro, after everything — she'd crossed the fur rug again, slipped back into the left bed, and been there when Persefoni woke up. She'd set the scene. She'd rearranged the evidence. And now she was up early — earlier than Persefoni, earlier than anyone — waking everyone with the cheerful energy of a girl who had absolutely nothing to hide.

She was good at this, Persefoni realized. Better than she'd thought.

"Come on, sleepy," Kathleen said, already out of bed, already moving, pulling clothes from her bag. "Your dad's talking about a castle."

The yurt smelled like woodsmoke and cold air. Everything from last night was invisible — the moonlight gone, the stove reduced to grey ash, the fur rug between the beds just a fur rug. Muffin was still propped against the low table, next to Sheepey, exactly where they'd left him. He looked like a muffin who'd seen things.

Kathleen was different. Persefoni saw it in the way she moved — a looseness in her body, a brightness in her face, a way of pulling on her sweater that said *something happened to me and it was wonderful.* She was humming. She kept looking at Alejandro with a softness in her eyes that Persefoni had never seen before — a tenderness so naked it was almost hard to look at. This was what Kathleen looked like when she'd been loved. Or thought she had.

Alejandro was not different. Alejandro was exactly the same — or rather, he was performing exactly-the-same so precisely that Persefoni could see the seams. He was reading something on his phone. He was talking about the schedule for today, whether there were more talks they could catch before leaving. He was being aggressively normal in the way that only someone with something to hide could be, every word landing like something rehearsed, every gesture a beat too steady. He had not once looked at Persefoni. Not once. He was being so careful about not looking at her that the not-looking was louder than looking would have been.

She filed this.

Persefoni was cheerful. She launched a Sheepey bit about hangovers before she'd even gotten out of bed — "He had rather too much ale at the festival. He's not proud of it but he's not apologizing either. Sheepey doesn't apologize. Sheepey *reflects.*" — and her voice was bright and her timing was perfect and she was, to anyone watching, exactly herself. But she hadn't looked at the space between the two beds. She hadn't looked at the fur rug. Her body was navigating around the memory of last night the way you walk around a hole in a floor — you don't look at it, you don't mention it, you just make sure your feet don't land there.

Her dad appeared at the yurt door, enormous and cheerful, already talking about the day's plan. Her mom was behind him, taking photos of the yurts in morning light — the canvas glowing white-gold in the sun, the fields behind them green and dewy, the mountains or hills or whatever they were doing that thing English countryside did where it looked like a painting that someone had over-saturated.

Nothing happened. Everything happened. The three of them got in the car.

---

Her dad was driving.

Her dad was always driving. He'd found a brochure somewhere — the man attracted brochures the way he attracted people, effortlessly, by existing in their vicinity — and her mom was reading from it in the passenger seat with the enthusiasm of someone being handed a present.

"It says it's the oldest stone fortification in Britain, George! Built by the Normans! In 1067!"

"A year after the conquest," Alejandro said, from the back seat.

"That's right, buddy!" her dad said, catching Alejandro's eye in the rearview mirror. "You know your history."

Alejandro lit up. He couldn't help it — her dad paid attention to him and he lit up, the same way he'd lit up at Stonehenge, the same way he always lit up when her dad aimed that beam of warmth in his direction. Persefoni watched it happen and felt the usual complicated thing she felt when she watched Alejandro with her dad — a mix of tenderness and sadness, because she knew what it cost Alejandro to need this, and she knew her dad gave it without thinking, the way he gave everything, without knowing what it meant to the person receiving it.

The car ride was different from the ones before. The Sheepey bits continued — Kathleen picked up the thread about the hangover, adding that Sheepey had been seen talking to a Welsh sheep of questionable reputation at the festival, and Persefoni built on it, and the rhythm was there, the old rhythm, the two of them constructing a world out of nothing. But there was a new frequency underneath. A tension Persefoni was aware of and managing.

Kathleen kept touching Alejandro. Small touches — her hand on his knee, her head leaning onto his shoulder, her fingers tracing the inside of his arm. She was claiming him. It didn't look conscious — Kathleen never seemed to do things strategically, that wasn't her — but Persefoni could read it. Kathleen was a girl who had been upgraded in her own story. She was adjusting to the new status. She was Alejandro's lover now, not just his girlfriend, and her body wanted the world to know it even if her mouth wasn't saying anything.

Alejandro allowed the touches the way he allowed everything with Kathleen — passively, without reciprocating, without objecting. He was looking out the window. He was thinking. His hand lay under hers on his knee like something left on a table.

Persefoni watched him not-touch-Kathleen-back. She added this to the unnamed collection.

---

Chepstow Castle was magnificent and ruined.

It sat on a cliff above the River Wye — the stone pale and weathered, stained with rust and lichen, the walls still standing but the roofs mostly gone so that you walked through rooms that were open to the sky. Arrow slits in the walls framed the countryside like narrow paintings — a strip of green, a strip of river, a strip of sky, each one composed and perfect as if the Normans had built the whole castle just to look through these slots. The wind came up off the river and moved through the castle freely — through doorways that had lost their doors centuries ago, through windows that had never held glass, through the open crowns of towers where the roofs had fallen in and the sky had taken their place.

Stone and wind. The castle held. The wind passed through.

Her dad spotted the pub before they'd even parked — a stone building across the road from the castle entrance, old and low-ceilinged, with hanging baskets outside and a chalkboard advertising Sunday lunch. It looked like it had been waiting for him personally.

"You kids go explore," he said, already steering her mom toward the door with his arm around her shoulders. "We'll be right here."

Her mom looked at the castle. Persefoni watched her mother's face — the way her eyes moved across the stone walls, the towers, the flags, the sheer ancientness of it — and saw the want. And Persefoni could see it — the way her mother's gaze lingered on the towers, the way her hand came up to shade her eyes as she traced the top of the walls. She looked like a woman standing at the edge of something she wanted to jump into.

Then her mom looked at her dad. Then at the pub.

"Oh, that does look nice," she said.

The same small surrender. The same folding-up of whatever she'd actually wanted, quick and neat, like someone closing a book they hadn't finished. Her dad was already inside. Her mom was already following. And Persefoni watched it happen and said nothing, because what was there to say? Her dad found the pub. Her mom followed. That was the pattern. It had been the pattern at the festival — her dad at the bar all day, her mom at the picnic table, the castle in Hay-on-Wye that neither of them had gone to see. Now here was another castle, and here was another pub, and here was her mom folding herself into her dad's version of the day.

Persefoni filed it alongside everything else she was filing today — Kathleen's touches, Alejandro's silence, her mother's surrenders. The unnamed collection grew.

So it was just the three of them. Which was worse, and better.

---

Persefoni loved the castle immediately.

She loved it the way she'd loved Stonehenge — not for the history, which she wouldn't remember, not for the dates, which she'd never bothered to learn, but for the feeling. The feeling of standing in a room that used to be a room and was now just walls and sky. The feeling of wind coming through stone that had been built to keep the wind out. Something had gotten in. The light, the air, the centuries — the castle had tried to hold everything in place and eventually the holding had failed and now it was more beautiful for the failure. The walls were stronger for being broken. The rooms were bigger for having no ceilings.

She moved through it quickly, intuitively, following whatever pulled her. A doorway that opened onto a staircase. A corridor that led to a room with a fireplace tall enough to stand in. A window that framed the river below like something painted. She didn't read the plaques. She didn't take notes. She just went where the castle wanted her to go, and the castle seemed to want her everywhere, every turn revealing something new — a patch of grass growing out of a wall ten feet up, a bird nesting in an arrow slit, the skeleton of a staircase climbing toward nothing.

Behind her, Alejandro was taking notes on his phone. Of course he was. Kathleen was beside him, holding his hand, and the two of them moved through the castle at a different speed — slower, more deliberate, Alejandro stopping to read every informational sign while Kathleen stood beside him with the patient expression of a girl who had learned that loving Alejandro meant waiting for Alejandro to finish reading things.

She found the great tower. The big one — the oldest-looking part, the one that felt like it had been there since before the rest of the castle had even been an idea. She put her hand on the stone and it was cold and slightly damp and it felt old the way the sea feels old — not as a fact but as a pressure, a weight you could sense in your palm. Inside, the rooms stacked on top of each other, connected by narrow spiral staircases worn smooth by God knew how many feet — the stone steps dished in the middle, curved like the inside of a spoon, and she ran her fingers along the groove as she climbed and thought about all the people who'd worn it down just by walking.

She climbed to the top.

The wind hit her face and the whole valley opened up below — the River Wye curving through green fields, the town small and scattered on the far bank, the hills beyond layered in shades of blue that got paler as they got farther away until the farthest ones were barely distinguishable from sky. The wind was steady and clean and it moved through her hair and pressed her shirt against her body and she stood there, in it, and for a moment she wasn't thinking about the yurt or the sounds or the gap between the beds or anything. She was just standing on top of a tower that had been standing for a thousand years and the wind was going through her and she was letting it.

Kathleen and Alejandro climbed up behind her.

---

She started the way she always started — casually, almost accidentally, as if the story had been there all along and she was just now noticing it.

"There was a princess who lived here."

She was looking out through a gap in the battlements where the stone had crumbled away, her back to them, her voice carrying on the wind.

Kathleen, immediately: "Obviously."

"Her name was..." — a beat, Persefoni looking around, letting the name find her the way names always found her — "Eleanor. Lady Eleanor of Chepstow. Very beautiful. Curly hair." She turned halfway, a glance over her shoulder at Alejandro. "Terrible curly hair. The kind of hair that did whatever it wanted and refused to be managed, which was a problem in the Norman period because hair in the Norman period was expected to behave."

Kathleen laughed. Alejandro did too — but a half-second late, like a man hearing a joke in a language he was still translating.

"Lady Eleanor had a best friend." Persefoni was walking now — moving along the top of the tower toward the staircase, her hand trailing the battlement wall. "A girl from the village. Round face. Big brown eyes. Sweet as anything — the kind of girl you'd trust with your life. They'd been inseparable since childhood. Since they were seven."

She wasn't looking at Kathleen. She didn't need to.

"And there was a boy." She reached the staircase and started down — the narrow spiral, the worn steps, her voice echoing off the stone. "A poet. Very clever. Curly hair — terribly curly, the kind that made the princess want to fix it and also never touch it. Wrote verses about the stars and the nature of consciousness and once wrote an entire ode to a particular quality of light that he observed on a Tuesday." She let that land. "He couldn't lift a sword to save his life. But his poetry — well. His poetry was rather good. Even the princess thought so, and the princess had very high standards."

She could hear them behind her on the staircase — Kathleen's shoes on the stone, Alejandro's slower, heavier step. She kept going.

"The poet courted the village girl. Everyone thought they were perfect. The village girl adored him. She'd sit for hours listening to him read his terrible — sorry, his *rather good* poetry, and she'd say 'that's beautiful, my love' every single time, whether it was or not. And the princess would watch them from the tower and think: yes, this is right. He has someone who loves him. She has someone who sees her. This is how it should be."

Her hand was on the cold stone wall. The staircase curved and curved and the light came and went as she passed each narrow window — bright, dark, bright, dark — each flash showing her the stone and then taking it away, the way a match shows you a room and then leaves you trying to remember what you saw. And her voice was steady, and the story was picking up speed and detail the way her stories always did, the way Sheepey's stories did, the way Muffin's story had, except this one had an edge. Something harder underneath. Something that wasn't there for Sheepey or Muffin. A blade under the silk.

"And one night," she said, and her voice did a thing she hadn't planned — it dropped, went quiet, the British accent still there but tighter now, each word placed like a stone in a wall — "the village girl crept across the stone floor of the castle to the poet's chamber."

She kept descending.

"And the princess was in the next room."

One more turn of the spiral.

"And the walls were very thick. But not thick enough."

Silence from behind her. Not the comfortable silence of two people listening to a story. A different silence — the silence of two people who had just heard a sound they recognized.

Persefoni didn't turn around. She kept her hand on the wall and she kept descending and her voice kept going, steady, level, the princess's story unspooling in the echo of the staircase.

"The princess heard everything. She lay in her bed and she listened and she didn't move. Because if she moved, they'd know she was awake. And then the village girl would be embarrassed. And the princess loved the village girl more than anyone in the castle — more than the poet, more than the king, more than anyone — and she would rather lie there all night in the dark than let her friend feel one moment of shame."

She came out of the staircase into the courtyard.

Open sky above. Wind through the ruined walls. Grass growing between the flagstones, bending in the breeze — bending and recovering, bending and recovering, never holding on. She walked to the center of the courtyard and turned around.

They were coming down the last steps of the staircase into the light. Kathleen first. Then Alejandro.

Whatever had happened on the staircase — however the words had landed, whatever their faces had done in the dark of the spiral while her back was to them — it was already over. She'd missed it. By the time they stepped into the courtyard she was looking at the aftermath.

Kathleen was white. Not pink, not flushed — white, the color gone from her face as if someone had drained it. Her mouth was set in a line that was trying to be normal and failing. Her eyes were wet but she wasn't crying — she was holding it, holding everything, the way you hold a glass you know is about to slip. She was gripping Alejandro's hand so hard her knuckles had gone the same color as her face.

Alejandro was rigid. Not frozen — locked, the way a machine locks when it encounters something it can't process. His jaw was tight. His eyes were on Persefoni and they had the flat, careful look of someone who had already gone through every emotion available and come out the other side into something that wasn't an emotion at all. He wasn't going to speak. She could see that. Whatever his system had done on the staircase, it had finished, and what was left was silence.

Persefoni looked at both of them.

The wind was moving through the courtyard. Bending the grass between the flagstones. Moving through her hair, pressing her shirt flat, flowing around her the way it flowed around the castle walls — passing through, never holding, never held. She was standing in it and she was furious. She didn't yell. She didn't break character. She let the fury live in the silence between the last sentence and whatever came next.

"The princess thought it was rather inconsiderate," she said. Quiet. Level. The British accent still there but barely — slipping, the real voice audible underneath like the wall beneath plaster. "She thought that if you're going to do that, you might at least have the decency to make sure the person in the next bed is actually asleep."

A beat.

"Or better yet — don't do it six feet from someone who loves you both. Because that's not brave. That's just careless."

The *you* landed.

Not the poet. Not the village girl. *You.* The fiction cracked open for exactly one word and then she pulled it shut again but it was too late — the word was out, it was in the air between them, loose and heavy and impossible to put back. Kathleen's face crumpled from white to something worse — something that looked like the beginning of tears but hadn't arrived there yet, a face caught between understanding and not wanting to understand, the terrible moment before a thing you've been not-thinking about becomes a thing you have to think about. Her lips pressed together. Her chin did something. She stared at Persefoni with those big round eyes and the eyes were asking a question she couldn't say out loud.

Alejandro's jaw had gone tight. His eyes were on Persefoni — fixed, unblinking, something working behind them that she could almost hear, like a machine with no output, spinning and spinning and finding no place to land. His hand was in Kathleen's and his body was the only honest part of him — it had taken a half-step back, an involuntary retreat, as if Persefoni's words were a physical thing he needed to make room for. He didn't speak. He looked like a man watching a building he'd built catch fire.

A beat. The wind. The castle. The sky through the broken walls, blue and indifferent and enormous.

Then Persefoni smiled — not warmly, not coldly, something in between, the kind of smile that said *I've said what I needed to say and now I'm done* — and she turned and walked toward the next section of the castle. Over her shoulder, in full Sheepey voice, bright and breezy as if nothing had happened, as if the last sixty seconds were a hallucination the wind had carried away:

"Anyway. The princess eventually married a Frenchman and moved to Bordeaux. She was much happier there. The wine was better and the walls were thicker."

She didn't look back.

---

Kathleen found her in the eastern range.

Not immediately. There had been — Persefoni didn't know how long. Five minutes. Ten. She'd walked through a sequence of rooms she couldn't have described afterward, roofless rooms with fireplaces in the walls and doorways opening onto nothing, and she'd been moving fast, not running but walking the way you walk when you need the movement to process the feeling, when sitting still would be worse than any direction. The wind was constant. It came through every opening and she let it come through her and by the time she stopped — in a room with three walls and a view of the river — the fury had burned down to something lower and steadier, an ember instead of a flame.

She heard Kathleen before she saw her. The footsteps on stone. Quick, uncertain — the sound of someone who wasn't sure she was welcome.

Kathleen came around a corner and stopped.

They looked at each other.

Kathleen's face was blotchy. She'd been crying — not a lot, not messily, but enough that her eyes were red and her nose was pink and she looked smaller than usual, which was saying something because Kathleen was already small. She was standing in the doorway with her arms wrapped around herself and she looked like a girl who had been dropped from a great height and was trying to figure out if anything was broken.

Neither of them spoke.

Then Kathleen reached for Persefoni's hand.

It was an old gesture. The oldest gesture between them — the way they'd walked together since they were eight years old, since the first sleepover, since every walk to school and from school and through malls and across parking lots. Kathleen's hand reaching for hers. The most basic unit of their friendship, the thing that said *I'm here* without requiring any words to hold it up.

Persefoni took it.

She took it because she loved Kathleen and because the anger was already losing to the love — it had been losing since she'd turned the corner into this room, since the wind had started pulling the heat out of it, since she'd seen Kathleen's blotchy face in the doorway looking like a girl who'd been told she'd done something terrible and couldn't figure out what. She took it because she'd said what she needed to say and she wasn't the kind of person who held a grudge. She was the kind of person who held a hand.

Kathleen's fingers closed around hers and they stood there for a moment, in a room with no roof, and the wind moved through it and around them and neither of them said anything and it was enough.

---

They walked.

Through the rest of the castle, hand in hand, the way they'd walked through everything since the beginning. Kathleen was quiet at first — tentative, her eyes flicking to Persefoni's face like she was reading weather, trying to determine if the storm was over or just pausing. Alejandro was behind them. Somewhere. Persefoni didn't look. She could hear his footsteps on the stone — slower than theirs, keeping distance, the sound of someone who understood he wasn't wanted in this particular formation right now.

They passed through the gatehouse — huge, the walls decorated with arrow loops and murder holes, the kind of architecture designed to kill anyone who entered uninvited — and Persefoni said, lightly, "The Normans were terrible at cooking."

Kathleen looked at her.

"Terrible. All they could make was boiled things. Boiled mutton. Boiled parsnips. They conquered England and then boiled it."

A pause. Kathleen's mouth twitched. Not a smile yet. The ghost of a smile visiting a face that wasn't sure it was allowed to smile.

"The thing about Norman soldiers," Persefoni continued, in a voice that was part British and part nothing and part the voice she used when she was building a bridge, "is that they'd storm a castle in twenty minutes and then spend four hours arguing about what to have for dinner. Very efficient at war. Very inefficient at supper."

Kathleen laughed. Small at first — barely a sound, more of a breath through her nose — and then bigger, and then real. It sounded the same as yesterday — the same laugh from the streets of Hay-on-Wye, the one that had stopped her mid-step outside the bookshops — but the air around it was different now. The laugh was the same. Everything else had moved. It was the one Persefoni had been waiting for, the one that meant *we're okay, or we're going to be okay, or at least we're going to try.*

"I bet they boiled the castle cat," Kathleen said.

"They absolutely boiled the castle cat. The castle cat was furious about it."

"Virtue would never let them."

Persefoni looked at her. Kathleen looked back. And something passed between them that Persefoni couldn't have put into words — a recognition, an apology that wasn't an apology because it didn't need to be one, a look that said *I know* and *I'm sorry* and *I love you* and *can we please not talk about this anymore,* all at the same time, all without a single word.

"Virtue," Persefoni said, "would have scratched every Norman in the castle and then written a song about it."

Kathleen squeezed her hand. Persefoni squeezed back.

Behind them, Alejandro's footsteps had stopped. He was standing somewhere — she didn't turn to look — probably in front of an informational plaque, probably reading it, probably taking notes on his phone, probably doing all the things Alejandro did when his system needed time to reboot. His notebook was in his bag. She suspected he hadn't taken it out. She suspected he had nothing to write.

She and Kathleen walked ahead, hand in hand, and Persefoni pointed at something in the wall — a carved stone face above a doorway, old and worn, its expression eroded to something that could have been a smile or a grimace.

"That's the head chef," she said. "He's been boiled."

Kathleen laughed again. Louder this time. The sound carried across the courtyard and bounced off the stone walls and went up through the open roof into the sky.

The wind moved through the castle. The laughter moved through the wind.

It wasn't fixed. But it was patched. And patching was what Persefoni did — she built over the cracks, she filled the gaps with story, she made things livable even when they weren't. The light got in through the cracks and she plastered over them with something funny and the light got in anyway, because that's what light did, and that's what cracks were for, and the castle had known this for a thousand years.

# All My Stories — Opening

The sheep didn't care about Stonehenge.

They were right there — maybe fifty yards from the path, a whole flock of them dotting the green like cotton balls someone had tossed across a pool table. Thousands of years of human mystery on one side of the fence and a bunch of sheep on the other, eating grass, doing absolutely nothing, unbothered by the fact that they were neighbors with the most famous rocks on Earth.

Persephone elbowed Kathleen. "They look so bored."

"They look like us in Mr. Henley's class."

"Oh my God, they do. That one is literally you. Look at her face. She's like — I cannot believe this is my life."

"That's not me. That's you. I actually pay attention."

"You pay attention to Sergey."

Kathleen shoved her, and Persephone laughed, and her dad turned around on the path ahead and gave them the look — the one that meant *I paid for this trip and you will appreciate these rocks* — and they both straightened up and put on serious faces for approximately four seconds before Kathleen whispered "baaaa" and they lost it again.

Kathleen wasn't family, but she might as well have been. She'd been Persephone's best friend since second grade, when Persephone had moved to Beaverton from Florida and showed up at school knowing nobody and Kathleen had sat next to her at lunch without being asked. She'd been sleeping over on weekends since they were eight. George called her "my other daughter." Rosemary packed her lunches too. They'd brought her on a trip to England the way you bring your kid's sister — because it wouldn't have occurred to anyone not to.

Sergey was up ahead with her parents, actually reading the informational plaques. He'd been talking about the acoustic properties of the stones for the last twenty minutes — something about how the bluestones had been carried two hundred miles from Wales because of the way they rang when you struck them, like bells, and how the ancient builders might have chosen them for their sound rather than their appearance. Her dad was asking good questions, or at least questions that sounded good. George had that gift — making whoever he was talking to feel like the most important person in the room. He'd been doing it for Rosemary for twenty years and he'd do it for a fifteen-year-old kid explaining rocks if that's what the moment called for. Sergey was Kathleen's boyfriend — had been for about a year, since they were all fourteen — and George treated him like a son he'd been issued by the state of Oregon. Sergey loved it. His own parents were academics who forgot to ask how his day was. George asked how his day was and then actually listened to the answer.

"They're like instruments," Sergey said, falling back on the path to walk beside them. He was talking to both of them but looking at Persephone. "The whole monument is like an instrument. They didn't build it to look at. They built it to listen to."

"That's kind of beautiful," Persephone said. "Like a church made out of sound."

Sergey stopped walking. "Yes," he said. "That's exactly what it is." He was looking at her the way he looked at a poem that surprised him — like she'd said something he'd been circling without landing on. Kathleen was holding his hand. Kathleen had been holding his hand the entire walk. And Persephone had just, without trying, without meaning to, said the thing that lit him up.

"Babe, come look at this one," Kathleen said, pulling Sergey toward a plaque about the solstice alignment, and the moment passed the way moments like that always passed between the three of them — quickly, without acknowledgment, like a cloud crossing the sun.

Her mom was taking photos. Rosemary took photos of everything — the stones, the sky, the informational signs, the gift shop from the outside, the gift shop from the inside, a bench. She'd post them all to Facebook later with captions that were slightly wrong in ways that made Persephone want to scream and also hug her. *Stonehinge is truly amazing! Built by the Druids 5000 years ago!* It wasn't built by the Druids and it wasn't five thousand years old — or maybe it was, Persephone wasn't sure, and that uncertainty would bother her if she thought about it, so she didn't.

Her parents were good. That was the thing about George and Rosemary that Persephone wouldn't understand until much later: they were simply, uncomplicatedly good. George did everything. He did the grocery shopping and the laundry and the bills and the driving and the planning and the deciding. He made dinner most nights and packed Persephone's lunch every morning and knew which of Rosemary's sweaters could go in the dryer and which couldn't and never once in Persephone's memory had he complained about any of it. He did it because he loved them. He loved Rosemary the way other men loved football — with a devotion so total it restructured his entire life around it. She was the most beautiful woman in the world. He'd been saying that since Alabama and he'd be saying it in the grave.

And Rosemary — Rosemary tried. She was always trying to do something nice for somebody. Cookies for the neighbors. Cards for birthdays she barely remembered in time. Volunteering at things she'd forget to show up to. She was kind in a way that was almost physical, like kindness was just something her body did the way other people's bodies breathed. But she couldn't balance a checkbook. She couldn't figure out the TV remote. When the internet went out she'd stand in front of the router and stare at it like it was a riddle from God. George would come home and fix it in ten seconds and she'd say "my hero" and she meant it, every time, and he'd glow.

Persephone had grown up in this. In a house where a man handled everything and a woman was cherished for existing. Where being beautiful and kind was enough, and the details would be taken care of by someone who loved you. She didn't know yet what that had done to her. She didn't know that she'd walk into every room for the next ten years expecting it to work the same way — expecting the world to handle the details while she sparkled. She just knew that her dad would carry her backpack if she asked and her mom would say yes to anything and life, so far, had been pretty great.

The gift shop was where it happened.

She wasn't looking for anything. She was killing time while Sergey finished reading every plaque in the exhibit — he was taking notes in his phone, actually taking notes, and Kathleen was leaning against a wall next to him with the patient expression of a girl who had learned that loving Sergey meant waiting for Sergey to finish reading things. Her mom was buying postcards. Her dad was buying her mom a cup of tea.

And there, on a shelf between a Stonehenge keychain and a book about ley lines, was a small stuffed sheep. Black wool, black face, barely three inches tall, with little legs sticking out at optimistic angles and a grin on his face that could only be described as sheepish — a grin that said *I know something you don't, but I'm too polite to say what.*

They both saw him at the same time.

"Oh my God," Kathleen said.

"I need him," Persephone said.

"You need him immediately."

"Daddy."

George turned. He was already reaching for his wallet. He'd been reaching for his wallet since she was born.

"That one. The sheep. Please."

He bought it without looking at the price, because George never looked at the price of anything his daughter wanted, and handed it to her, and she held it up to Kathleen, and Kathleen gasped and pressed her hands to her face and said "oh my God he's adorable" and Persephone said "he's perfect" and that was the moment Sheepey was born.

"His name," Persephone announced, holding him at eye level and studying his little grin, "is Sheepey." She said it the way a French person might — *shee-PAY* — with a gravity that implied centuries of noble lineage.

Kathleen didn't miss a beat. "Sheepey," she repeated, in a British accent that was actually pretty good. "From Stone*henge*." She leaned on the second syllable the way the British did, like the word was a fancy door you had to push open from the back end.

"Stone*henge*," Persephone confirmed. "Very old place."

"Very old. Very distinguished."

"Bit of a drinker, though."

"Oh, terrible. Absolutely terrible drinker. Can't hold his lager."

"And the gambling."

"The *gambling*. Don't even get me started on the gambling."

"He's lost two estates."

"Three. Three estates and a yacht."

"Sheepey doesn't have a yacht."

"He used to. He gambled it away. Do keep up."

They were in full British accent now, both of them, building Sheepey's biography with the speed and precision of two people who had been doing exactly this kind of thing since they were seven years old. By the time they got back to the car, Sheepey had a gambling debt, a fondness for single malt, a disgraced military career, an ex-wife named Tabitha who'd left him for a goat farmer in Devon, and a deep and abiding melancholy that he masked with charm.

George tried the accent from the driver's seat. "Well, Sheepey ol' chap," he said, in something that sounded like a British person having a stroke in Birmingham, Alabama, "welcome to the family."

"Dad. No."

"What?"

"You cannot do that accent."

"I thought it was pretty good."

"It was not pretty good."

Rosemary tried next. It was worse. It was so much worse. It was British by way of the Florida panhandle, every vowel bent in directions vowels were never meant to go. "Cheerio, Sheepey!" she said, beaming.

Kathleen put her hand on Persephone's arm. "Make them stop."

"I can't make them stop. They're adults."

"Pip pip!" said George.

"Oh my God," said Kathleen.

"*Brilliant!*" said Rosemary, who had apparently learned the word from a BBC show and had been waiting for a chance to use it.

Persephone looked at Kathleen. Kathleen looked at Persephone. Sheepey looked at nothing, because he was a stuffed animal, but if he could have looked at something it would have been the window, because Sheepey was the kind of man who stared out of car windows and thought about the choices he'd made.

"This is going to be a long trip," Kathleen said, in her own voice.

"The longest," Persephone said.

The laughter settled. George turned up the radio. Rosemary went back to her phone. And in the quiet that followed, Sergey — wedged between Kathleen and the door — was watching Persephone with the half-smile of someone cataloging data. He was always doing that. Watching her like she was a phenomenon he was trying to classify. Kathleen didn't notice, or if she did she'd decided it was just how Sergey looked at everyone. It wasn't how Sergey looked at everyone.

But she was smiling. She was smiling in a way she wouldn't understand until much later — the way you smile when you're in the middle of the best thing in your life and you don't know it yet. She had her best friend and her parents and a stuffed sheep with a drinking problem and the English countryside was sliding past the window like a painting being slowly unrolled, and she was fifteen years old, and nothing bad had ever happened to her, and she thought that was because she was lucky.

It wasn't because she was lucky. It was because she was fifteen.

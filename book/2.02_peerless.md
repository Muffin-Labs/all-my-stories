Six weeks of her scalp.

That was what it came down to. Not the face — though the face was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen, and he'd seen faces, he'd seen the kind of faces that made rooms go quiet. Not the body, though the body was a fact so complete it was almost redundant — the long legs, the golden skin, the way she moved through space like she'd been choreographed by someone who understood how light worked. Not the voice, not the laugh, not the way she said things that made him stop chewing and stare at her because nobody had ever said anything like that in front of him and he was twenty years old and he'd met everyone.

Her scalp. The scent of it. The particular chemistry at the top of her head, in the roots of those curls, the warm alive smell that hit him every time she sat close enough, every time she turned her head, every time he leaned in and caught it — and he leaned in, he leaned in constantly, inventing reasons, reaching past her for the remote, brushing her shoulder as he passed, standing behind her on the balcony so the bay wind would push it toward him.

Six weeks. She'd been in Florida since May. It was July now and the storm was coming and her scent was on his pillows, on the couch where they watched movies, in the air of her condo after she walked through a room, and he had been breathing her in for six weeks the way a man breathes in oxygen — involuntarily, constantly, the wanting so deep in his body it had become a background condition, a hum he carried everywhere, onto the field, into the weight room, into the shower where her scent washed off his skin and he missed it before the water hit the drain.

He was on her couch. The Weather Channel was on. Elsa was tracking across the Gulf and he was reading the cone the way he read a coverage map — tendencies, trajectories, the probabilities converging on a point. The wind speeds. The surge projections. Tampa Bay was vulnerable, the geography of it, the funnel shape that amplified surge, and his house on Davis Islands was at sea level and he'd moved what needed moving and come across the bridge to her tower because she'd asked and because her asking was the only reason he needed for anything.

She was at the window. The sky behind her was doing something — going yellow-grey, charging up, the light changing the way light changes before a fight, before a play, before the thing that's been building finally arrives. She was standing there and the storm was behind her and he could see her silhouette against the sick sky and her curls were wild from the humidity, the air pulling moisture from everything, and even from the couch he could smell her. Across the room. Through the antiseptic tang of hurricane prep, through the candle she'd lit, through the air itself. Her.

*Seis semanas.* Six weeks of this. Six weeks of wanting that lived below thought, below decision, in the place where the body just knew. He'd told her on the first night — *I want you, I just want you to know that* — because that was how he handled things: he said them. Directly. The way you throw a ball to a receiver: not around the defender, not with spin to get past the obstacle, but through it, hard and fast and accurate and let the receiver do the rest. He'd said it and she'd said not yet and he'd said okay and meant it because the outcome was never in question. He'd been waiting the way he waited for the snap count. Calm. Ready. The play was already called.

"Come here," she said.

He looked up. She was at the window and the storm was behind her and she was backlit by something ugly and enormous and she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his life.

He went to her.

"Not tonight," she said. And then — almost laughing, shaking her head at herself — "No. I mean — *tonight.*"

His face did the thing. He felt it happen — the stillness before the rest, the half-second where everything in his body aligned, the way it aligned at the line of scrimmage when he saw the coverage and knew, *knew* with the certainty that was his whole self, that the play was going to work. The smile came after. The smile always came after.

Then his hands were on her waist and her mouth was on his mouth and the rain hit the windows like a freight train and he picked her up — 130 pounds, nothing, a warm light thing in his arms — and the storm was outside and she was inside and the six weeks collapsed into the space between their bodies and the space was zero and the wanting was over and the having had begun.

---

Afterward.

She was asleep. He was not.

The storm was winding down outside, the rain going from percussion to static, the building settling around them like an animal that had braced and now could breathe. The city lights below threw patterns on the ceiling — moving, liquid, the reflection of water on glass. Her ceiling. Her room. Her bed.

He was on his back and she was against his side, her head on his chest, and her hair was in his face and the scent — *Dios mío* — the scent was everywhere now, amplified by the heat of her body and the heat of what they'd done and the closed space of the bedroom, concentrated, the most alive he'd felt off a football field. He breathed in through his nose, deep, filling his lungs with it, and the breathing was everything. The whole world reduced to the diameter of his next inhale.

*Valió la pena.* Worth the wait.

Not because he was noble. He wasn't noble. Noble was for men who waited because they were scared the answer might be no. He'd waited because the answer was always going to be yes and the waiting was just the distance between the snap and the throw — the pocket forming, the receiver running his route, the ball already in the air in his mind before his arm released it.

She breathed against his chest. Her breath was warm and slow and her body was small against his, smaller than it looked when she was standing, when the height and the presence made her seem larger than her weight. 130 pounds. He knew this the way he knew his own measurements — bodies were data, bodies told you everything, and hers told him she fit against him like she'd been designed to, the angles complementary, the physics of it solved.

He turned his head and pressed his mouth against the top of her head and breathed in again and the breathing was a sacrament, a prayer he didn't have words for because he didn't need words. His body was the prayer. His body had always been the prayer.

Football tomorrow. Her and football. Two drives. Two channels of everything he had. A man with two perfect things and the body to do both of them justice.

He closed his eyes and the closing was the easiest thing he'd done all day.

---

The summer was golden.

Training camp started and the NFL machine swallowed him and he went willingly, the way he'd gone willingly into every system that had ever claimed him — Pop Warner, high school, Alabama, the draft. Systems loved Démion. They opened for him the way rooms opened when he walked in, the way defenses opened when he scrambled, the way everything in his life had opened since the first time he'd picked up a football at six years old in his abuela's yard in Hialeah and thrown it over the neighbor's fence and his tío had said *este niño* with a look on his face that Démion would later recognize as the look of a man seeing the future arrive early.

The facility. 6 AM. The weight room first — the iron, the burn, the precise destruction and reconstruction of muscle, the body as a project, a cathedral being built and rebuilt every day. Then film. The mind serving the body: he watched defenses the way a hunter watches terrain, looking for the seam, the gap, the moment the coverage broke and the receiver would be there and his arm would deliver the ball into the space that existed for the half-second before it closed. He didn't analyze the way a coach analyzed — taxonomies, tendencies charted on whiteboards, the intellectual architecture of strategy. He absorbed. He saw the play once and his body remembered it. He saw the blitz package three times and his feet already knew where to go. The intelligence was muscular, neurological, lived in the synapses between seeing and doing, and the distance between those two things was shorter in Démion than in any quarterback who had ever played the game.

Then her.

He'd come back from the facility smelling like turf and sweat and Gatorade and she'd be on her balcony or in her kitchen or on his couch — his place, her place, the bay between them a commute he crossed without thinking, the thirty minutes of bridge and highway no more significant than the distance between the huddle and the line. One night she was on his couch with her legs folded under her, eating takeout pad thai with chopsticks, and she said something about Sheepey — the stuffed sheep, the character, the bit she did — that made him laugh so hard the beer came out of his nose, and she pointed a chopstick at him and said "Don't you dare" with her mouth full, and the moment was nothing, was ordinary, was a Tuesday in July, and it was the best moment of his life that didn't involve a football. She was there. He was there. The relationship existed the way the summer existed — warm and continuous and so present he didn't think to examine it. You didn't examine weather when the weather was perfect. You just stood in it.

Her and football. Football and her. He didn't analyze the relationship. He didn't build a framework or look for meaning or ask himself what they were becoming. He was in it.

George walked through the door and filled the room.

Not metaphorically. The man was 6'4" and built like a building, and when he came through the condo door on the Thursday before the opener the whole space rearranged itself around him — Persephone's condo, her furniture, her art on the walls, all of it suddenly scaled to George Minton, who crossed the threshold like a man crossing a stage, arms wide, voice already going.

"THERE he is!" George said, and the voice — deep, Southern, the kind of voice that made the air around it vibrate — hit Démion in the chest like a greeting from a man he'd known his whole life. "The man himself. Baby, let me look at you."

He extended his hand and Démion took it. The handshake was a real handshake — two big men, the grip firm and certain, the eye contact steady. Démion was 6'6" and George was 6'4" and the two inches didn't matter. What mattered was the recognition. Two men who knew what they were. Two men who filled rooms without trying and understood, without discussing it, the physics of being that size — the way people moved around you, the way conversations oriented toward you, the way a room found its center when you entered it.

"Pleasure, sir," Démion said.

"Sir! Baby girl, he called me sir. I love this man already." George pulled him into a hug — not a handshake-hug, the careful half-contact that men used when they weren't sure, but a real hug, a full *abrazo*, the kind Démion's family gave, the kind that said *you belong to us now.* George's arms around his back, the pat-pat-pat, the warmth of it, and Démion felt something that surprised him — a flicker of home. The physical language of large affectionate men, the same in every culture, the greeting that meant *I see you and you are mine.*

Rosemary came through the door behind George, and Rosemary was the opposite of George in every physical dimension — 5'2", blonde, petite, smiling the way a small person smiles when she enters a room behind a large one, the smile that said *I'm here too* without needing anyone to make space for it because George had already made all the space.

"Hi," she said. Sweet. Trying. The kind of woman you saw next to a man like George and understood — the trophy, the blonde, the beautiful small thing on the arm of the large magnetic thing. She extended her hand and Démion shook it gently because the hand was small and he was aware of the physics of his grip and the bones inside it.

"Ma'am," he said.

"Oh, Rosemary, please," she said, and her smile widened and she looked at Persephone and there was something in the look — something Démion registered and didn't catalog, because cataloging wasn't what he did with other people's faces. She struck him as sweet. Trying. That was enough.

George was already talking. George had been talking since before the door opened and would continue talking until the door closed and probably after — the voice pouring out of him like weather, warm and continuous, stories and questions and observations and the particular energy of a man who treated silence like a problem only he could solve. "This condo — baby, this VIEW — Démion, you've been up here, you've seen this? Twenty-three floors! Rosemary, come look at this. The BAY, baby. You can see the whole — is that Davis Islands right there? That's your neighborhood, right?"

"Yes sir," Démion said.

"There it is. Right across the water. Y'all are right there." George stood at the window, hands on hips, surveying the bay like a general surveying a conquered territory, and Démion watched him and liked him, liked the size and the warmth and the certainty of him. Démion watched him and felt the ease of it — another big man, another man who walked into a room knowing the room would adjust. He liked George the way he liked good linemen: solid, reliable, the kind of presence that made the pocket feel safe.

---

He stayed that night.

Persephone's condo. Her parents in the guest room. The air conditioning hummed through the vents and the city threw its light through the blinds in thin bright lines across the floor. The door closed and the hallway between them — George and Rosemary on one side, Persephone and Démion on the other — and the hallway was not a distance. It was a fact. He was in her bed, in her home, while her family was there, and the thereness of it was the point.

Not the sex. The sex had been confirmation — her body telling him what he already knew, the six weeks of scent and wanting resolving into the obvious conclusion. Not the dating. Dating was the commute, the bridge and the highway, the process of crossing the distance between two people who were already going to arrive at each other. This — the guest room, the hallway, the family on the other side of the wall — this was the destination.

He lay in the dark with his hand on her hip, her back against his chest, and he could hear George's voice through the wall — low, a murmur, talking to Rosemary the way George talked to everyone, which was constantly. And the sound of it — the father's voice, the bass note of a family happening — landed in Démion's chest in a place he didn't visit often. Home. Not the house on Davis Islands. Not the facility. The other home, the real one, the one he'd left when he went to Alabama at seventeen, his mother and his abuela and his tíos and the noise of them, the constant generous noise of people who loved each other and proved it by never being quiet.

He pressed his mouth against the top of Persephone's head. Breathed in. The scent.

He was ready to marry this girl.

The thought arrived the way his best plays arrived — not as a decision but as a recognition. Something he already knew becoming conscious. The way you don't decide to see an open receiver. You just see him. The body and the brain arriving at the same fact at the same time, and the fact was so obvious it was almost funny that it had taken this long to notice.

*Me voy a casar con ella.*

He didn't say it out loud. He didn't need to. The decision was made. The decision had been made somewhere in the six weeks of her scalp, or in the hurricane night when she'd finally said yes, or in the doorway an hour ago when George had hugged him and the hug had felt like coming home. Somewhere in there the play had been called. All that was left was the snap.

---

Morning.

George was making coffee. This, Démion would learn, was what George did — he made coffee in other people's kitchens the way he entered other people's rooms: as if the space had been waiting for him. The coffee maker was Persephone's but the coffee was George's — he'd brought it from Oregon, a specific roast, the good stuff, and he was standing in the kitchen with a mug in each hand and a story already in progress.

"— and I'm telling you, the man looked at me, and I said, 'Brother, I've been to Tuscaloosa. I have *been* to Tuscaloosa. You cannot tell me about—'" George saw Démion in the hallway and the story redirected without pausing, the way a river redirects around a stone without slowing down. "Démion! Coffee? I made the good stuff. Rosemary, get this man a mug. Big man like that needs a big mug, baby, not one of those little—"

"I got it, George." Rosemary was at the counter, already holding a mug, already pouring. She handed it to Démion and her smile was the same sweet trying smile from the night before, and her eyes moved across his face the way eyes do when a person is reading something, and he took the mug and said "Thank you, ma'am" and drank.

Breakfast happened around George. The eggs, the toast, Rosemary asking how he liked them — over easy, *por favor*, the *por favor* sliding out before he could stop it, the Spanish that lived in his mouth the way English lived there too, two languages sharing the same space, taking turns. George was already telling a story about Alabama, about Tuscaloosa, about the time Bear Bryant said something to someone who said something to George's father's friend, and the story was three stories deep and climbing and Démion ate his eggs and listened and liked the man, liked the warmth of him, liked the way the kitchen felt with George in it — full, loud, alive.

Persephone was at the counter with her coffee, watching. Watching George. Watching Démion. Those green eyes moving between faces, quiet, steady — and Démion caught her eye and she smiled and the smile was not the public smile, not the camera smile. It was the one she gave him in the dark, the private one, and it landed in his chest the way her scent landed in his chest, below thought, in the place where the body just knew.

*Mía.*

---

Opening day. Bucs versus Cowboys. And George walked into the box in a Dallas Cowboys jersey and an Alabama hat.

The number four Dak Prescott jersey, crisp, the kind of jersey that got worn every Sunday with conviction. And on his head — crimson A, sat high the way hats sat on big men, perched, not worn, the hat knowing it was there by grace not necessity. He walked through the suite door like he was walking onto his own property, arms wide, grinning, and Démion looked at him and laughed.

*Clásico.*

Cowboys fan. America's Team. Everybody and their mother. Démion had met a thousand Cowboys fans — the breed was everywhere, the most common football species, the people who chose the team the way they chose a brand: not by geography, not by loyalty, but by the certainty that they deserved the best and the Dallas star was the symbol of the best. George in his Prescott jersey was the most George thing George could be, and Démion shook his head and grinned and that was the end of it.

He didn't think about it again. George was George — the big man, the warm voice, the father in the box in enemy colors, grinning at the field like the field was a gift someone had wrapped for him. Simple. Complete.

Rosemary sat in the corner of the suite with a glass of wine and her phone. He didn't look at her again until halftime, and even then only to ask if she needed anything. She said she was fine. She was smiling. He went back to the game.

---

The field.

This was his. Everything else — the scent, the wanting, the family, the condo, the bay, the bridge he crossed — everything else was the life that happened between fields. This was the thing itself. The grass under his cleats, the crowd above him, the stadium holding sixty-five thousand voices that were there for one reason: to watch him do what he was born to do.

He could feel it in the tunnel. The vibration. Not the noise — the noise was above him, muffled by stone and concrete, a rumble that came through the walls like weather. The vibration was in his body. The pre-game electricity that started in his feet and climbed through his legs and settled in his chest and became the calm. The opposite of nervous. The arrival. The moment where the waiting was over and the doing could begin.

He ran onto the field and the stadium exploded and the explosion was for him.

Not only for him — for the team, for the franchise, for the promise of a season that started here, tonight, under the lights. But he was the fulcrum. He was the first overall pick. He was the reason the stadium was full and the cameras were pointed and the broadcast had been promoted for weeks. He was the thing they'd come to see. His body had been telling him so since he was six years old in his abuela's yard: *you are built for this.*

The game was a demolition.

The first drive: seven plays, eighty yards, the ball arriving in his receivers' hands like it had been delivered by GPS. The second drive: a scramble, the pocket collapsing, his feet finding the seam the way his nose found her scent — instinctual, involuntary, the body solving the problem before the mind could name it — and then the throw, off-platform, sidearm, a thirty-yard bullet between two defenders who didn't know they'd already lost. The crowd noise hit a frequency that lived in his bones. The stadium was a body and he was the heartbeat.

He played the way he'd always played — improvisational, impossible, the reads coming before the snap, his body carving through space the way his body always carved through space, the defenders a step behind and the ball already gone. The announcers were saying things. The coaches were saying things. The sixty-five thousand people in the stands were saying things, and all of those things were the same thing, which was the thing Démion had always known, the thing every system he'd ever entered had confirmed, the thing his body proved every time it touched a football:

Nobody else could do this. The thought didn't arrive as pride — it arrived as fact, the way the score arrived on the board, the way the ball arrived in his receivers' hands. Nobody else had this arm. Nobody else had these feet. Nobody else stood in a collapsing pocket and saw the whole field at once and threw a strike forty yards downfield while two men tried to drag him to the earth. Every statistic. Every replay. Every defender who thought he had the angle and didn't. Stone-cold, inarguable fact.

He looked up at the suite between drives and he couldn't see her face but he knew she was there. He could feel her the way he felt the field — through the body, through the sense that lived below thought. She was watching and the watching was the other half of the equation. The field proved he was peerless. She proved he was loved. Two kinds of confirmation, running in parallel, each complete.

The game ended. The score didn't matter — it was lopsided, embarrassing for Dallas, the kind of game that made people say *we've never seen anything like this* because they hadn't. He walked off the field and the tunnel swallowed the crowd noise and the stone walls were cool against the heat pouring off his skin and the sweat was drying and his body was humming and the humming was the best feeling in the world — the body after the game, still electric, still ready, the machine at full power with nothing left to prove tonight.

---

He found her in the tunnel.

The families, the staff, the organized chaos of postgame — bodies everywhere, people with lanyards and clipboards, kids running, wives waiting, the particular noise of a stadium emptying overhead. He came around the corner and she was there and her green eyes found him before he could speak and she was smiling — the private smile, the real one, the one that lived underneath the public face — and he didn't say anything. He walked to her and picked her up.

Just picked her up. His hands on her waist, lifting, the way you'd lift a child, except she wasn't a child — she was 5'8" and 130 pounds and the most extraordinary woman he'd ever met, and she weighed nothing. Nothing at all. She was in his arms and her legs wrapped around him and the stadium was still loud above them and he'd just played the best game of his life and she was here and the two things — the field and her, her and the field — were both true at the same time and the truth of it was so obvious and so complete that it felt like the answer to a question he hadn't known he was asking.

Her scent. Even through the sweat and the turf and the antiseptic — her scalp, her hair, the warm alive thing at the roots of those curls. He pressed his face against her head and breathed in.

*Mía.*

Not possession. Recognition. The way a thing that belongs to you feels when you hold it. The way your hand knows your glove. The way your arm knows the ball. The specific rightness of a thing in its place, and she was in her place, which was in his arms, 130 pounds off the ground, in a tunnel that smelled like concrete and victory and the body of a man who had just proven to the world what he'd always known about himself.

He held her. The tunnel buzzed around them and he held her and she held him back and for a moment — one moment, the length of a held breath — the two drives were one drive and the narrowing was a point and the point was here.

---

One week later.

The decision arrived the way his best decisions arrived — not as deliberation, not as the careful weighing of options, not as the architecture of pros and cons that other people built when they were trying to figure out what to do. The decision arrived the way a play arrived: he saw the opening and he took it.

He was going to propose.

Not because of a timeline. Not because of a plan. Not because four months was enough time or not enough time or the right time or the wrong time. Because the data was complete. Every system he'd ever entered had confirmed that he got what he reached for — the scholarships, the championships, the draft, the game, the girl. He was reaching for this.

He bought the ring on a Tuesday. A jeweler in Tampa, the kind of place that athletes went, the kind of place where the cases were locked and the stones were real and the man behind the counter didn't blink at numbers that would have made a different man sit down. Démion pointed at what he wanted and paid for it and put the box in his jacket pocket and drove across the bridge to St. Pete.

The ring sat in his pocket like a stone. A small, perfect weight against his thigh, warm from his body, the hardest thing he'd ever carried and the easiest decision he'd ever made.

He knew what she'd say. He knew the way he'd known on the hurricane night — the way he'd known in the tunnel, in the suite, in the kitchen with George making coffee and Rosemary pouring and the family happening around him like weather. He knew because he was Démion and Démion had never been wrong about what came next. The play was called. The receiver was open. The ball was already in the air.

He drove across the bridge and the bay was flat and blue beneath him and the sun was going down over the Gulf, turning the water gold and then red — the whole sky red, the bay red, the bridge cutting through it like a line drawn between two lives that were about to become one. He had a ring in his pocket and a stone in his chest and a game behind him and a life in front of him.

He already knew the outcome.

The bridge carried him forward and the water shone below and somewhere in the city ahead his future was waiting and his future smelled like the top of her head and his body was singing with the certainty of a man who had never once been told no.

Not yet, she'd said. Not yet was not no. Not yet was soon. Not yet was the snap count, the pocket forming, the receiver breaking open downfield.

He was Démion. He already knew.

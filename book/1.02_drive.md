---

Someone had named a festival after a line of poetry.

The road was narrow and winding and the hedgerows scraped the side mirrors every time a car came the other way, and George kept saying "whoopsie" like it was a ride at a carnival, and Rosemary kept grabbing the dashboard, and the girls in the back seat were doing Sheepey's biography in British accents for the third consecutive hour, and Alejandro had his forehead against the window and was not listening to any of it.

Not a music festival, not a food festival — a philosophy festival. In a tiny town in Wales full of bookshops. And they'd named it after Leonard Cohen. *How The Light Gets In.* Alejandro had found the festival online over a year ago and had been carrying it around in his head ever since, the way other people carried around concert dates or vacation countdowns. When he'd heard the family was planning a trip to London — Persefoni mentioned it at lunch, casually, the way she mentioned everything, as if the world just arranged itself around her — he'd spent two weeks figuring out how to make Hay-on-Wye happen. He couldn't ask his own parents. His own parents would have looked at the festival website, noted that it wasn't a conference with proceedings and a DOI, and gone back to their laptops. *Ni modo.* That was his mother's phrase for the small surrenders — the things you stopped fighting because the fighting cost more than the losing. But George — George said yes the way George always said yes, which was immediately and completely, because a fifteen-year-old kid was excited about something and that was reason enough. So now they were driving there, and the fact that they were driving there — that this was actually happening — made him want to press his face against the window and stare at the road the way other kids stared at the approach to Disneyland.

*There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.*

He loved that line the way he loved very few things — completely, without reservation, without the usual need to take it apart and see how it worked. Most poetry he admired technically. He could explain why a line was good — the meter, the imagery, the way the vowels opened up at the end. But the Cohen line didn't need explaining. It just landed. It said the broken thing is the holy thing, and it said it in ten words, and those ten words had been rattling around in Alejandro's skull since he'd first heard "Anthem" on a playlist in junior high, and now someone had taken those words and built a whole festival around them and filled it with people who thought the way he thought, and he was going to be there tomorrow.

But the festival wasn't even the main thing. The main thing was McGilchrist.

He'd found the book almost two years ago, in a used bookstore on Hawthorne, wedged between a water-stained copy of *Being and Nothingness* and someone's abandoned PhD thesis on Heidegger. *The Master and His Emissary.* Iain McGilchrist. The cover was plain, the subtitle was academic, and the first paragraph had rearranged something inside his skull that hadn't gone back to its original shape since.

The argument, stripped to its frame: the brain's two hemispheres didn't do what everyone thought they did. It wasn't left-for-logic, right-for-creativity — that was pop science, a bumper sticker version of something immeasurably more complex. What McGilchrist proposed was that the hemispheres offered two fundamentally different *modes of attention.* The right saw the whole — the gestalt, the living world in all its interconnected, never-fully-graspable totality. The left broke the whole into parts, labeled them, categorized them, made them useful. The right was the master. The left was its emissary — its envoy, its helper, its bureaucrat.

And the emissary had forgotten it was the emissary.

That was the part Alejandro couldn't stop turning over. The car took a curve and his forehead knocked the cool glass and he left it there — the engine humming through his skull, Kathleen's laugh ringing off the low ceiling of the Vauxhall — and kept thinking. Not the neuroscience — he'd watched enough YouTube lectures to follow the fMRI data, the split-brain experiments, the lesion studies — but the *image.* The story McGilchrist had wrapped around the science. A master who sent a trusted servant to manage his lands. The servant, clever and efficient, began to believe he was the one in charge. Over time, the master's voice grew quieter. The servant's voice grew louder. And eventually the kingdom forgot there had ever been a real master at all.

It was, Alejandro thought, the most important story he'd ever heard. And he'd spent the months since trying to figure out how to tell it to other people without sounding like a textbook. This was his problem. It was, if he was honest, the central problem of his life so far: the distance between what he understood and what he could make anyone else feel. He could explain the divided brain in technical terms — lateralization of function, the relationship between focal and broad attention, the phenomenological implications of left-hemisphere dominance in the apprehension of the lived world. He could be precise. He could be accurate. He could be completely, perfectly correct and put everyone in the room to sleep. *No alcanza.* The words don't reach — his mother said this about grant proposals that wouldn't cohere, and now it was his. The car bounced through a pothole — George laughing, Rosemary clutching the dashboard — and Alejandro held on to the thought.

What he wanted — what he worked for, what he stayed up writing lyrics for until two in the morning, what he chased every time he picked up his guitar or sat down with a blank page — was to make someone feel what he felt when he read that book. Not understand it. *Feel* it. The way a song could make you feel something before you knew what it meant.

His music helped. Kind of. He recorded under the name & Amateur Cartography — stolen from a Weakerthans song called "Aside" — *circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty, armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography* — because Alejandro was the kind of person who named things after other things and expected you to follow the reference. He did everything himself — wrote the songs, layered the tracks, built the arrangements on his laptop one part at a time. Experimental pop, layered and hypnotic, built on pulsing rhythms that felt primal underneath the cerebral lyrics — Animal Collective by way of a kid who'd read too much McGilchrist. Songs that got into your body before your brain had time to object. Songs about things like a man who builds a house out of his own memories and then can't find the door, or a woman who teaches a river to speak and then can't make it stop talking. In the lyrics he could do the thing he couldn't do in conversation — he could take a philosophical concept and fold it into a story strange enough that the concept disappeared and only the feeling remained. And underneath the stories, the rhythms did their own work — looping, building, the kind of pulse that made you sway before you realized you were swaying.

But he couldn't do it *talking.* Talking, the concepts came out first and the feeling came out never. He'd been working on the McGilchrist explanation since he'd read the book. Trying different angles. The king and the servant was the best he'd come up with, but it still felt like a translation — something that gestured at the original without capturing it. He wanted the explanation to land the way the last verse of a good song lands, where you don't think *I understand* but rather *oh.* Just: *oh.* He could feel the road climbing now, every gear change vibrating up through the floor of the car into his bones.

He hadn't found it yet. Then he'd found the festival — a whole gathering named after the Cohen line, with McGilchrist himself on the schedule — and it stopped being an idea and became a mission. McGilchrist was speaking tomorrow, and Alejandro was going to be in the room, and that was enough to make the two-hour drive to Hay-on-Wye feel like the drive to something that mattered.

George was driving. He was too big for the rental — six-four, broad through the shoulders, his head nearly brushing the ceiling of the little Vauxhall. His hands looked like they could palm the steering wheel, and he drove with one of them, the other gesturing along to whatever he was saying, occasionally reaching over to squeeze Rosemary's knee. The man was incapable of being in a space without filling it. Not loudly, not aggressively — George wasn't aggressive about anything. He just radiated, the way a campfire radiates. You came to him. You leaned in. He was warm and you wanted to be near the warmth.

Alejandro loved George.

This was not a small thing and he didn't think about it casually. His own father, Dr. Carlos Rodriguez, was a research scientist at Intel — same campus as George, same company, different universe. Carlos worked in semiconductor process development. George was a technician on the fabrication floor. They'd met at a company picnic when Alejandro was in middle school, and the friendship between the families had been immediate and lopsided in a way that Alejandro found both comforting and painful to think about.

His parents loved him. He knew this the way he knew the periodic table — factually, abstractly, with confidence in the underlying data. They asked about his grades. They came to his school events when they remembered. They had given him a childhood full of books and silence and the implicit understanding that the life of the mind was the only life worth living. What they hadn't given him was the thing George gave everyone within a five-foot radius: the feeling that you were the most interesting person who had ever existed.

George asked Alejandro how his day was. George asked follow-up questions. George remembered the answers and brought them up later, weeks later, like a man who kept a careful inventory of other people's lives because those lives mattered to him. When Alejandro explained the bluestones at Stonehenge, George had leaned in and asked, "So they picked them for the sound? Like choosing an instrument?" and Alejandro had felt, for a brief moment, seen in a way his own father had never made him feel. *Así se siente.* So this is what it feels like.

He loved the whole family. He loved this car, this trip, this borrowed life that fit him better than his own. And he loved George's daughter in a way that was going to be a problem.

He'd been in love with her since the first time she'd said something that made him stop mid-sentence — some offhand thing, he couldn't even remember what, freshman year, and it had landed in him like a tuning fork struck against a table and he'd been vibrating at her frequency ever since. He loved her voice and her mind and the way she moved through rooms like they'd been built for her. He loved the chocolate curls that caught light from impossible angles — curls that mirrored his own in a way that felt like a cosmic joke, hers wild and effortless, his just messy — and the pale green eyes that had no business existing against that golden brown skin — eyes that made you forget what you were saying, that held you like a hand around your throat, gentle and total. He loved that when he looked at her he couldn't look away, that her face was the fixed point around which his entire field of vision organized itself. He loved her the way you love something you know you'll never deserve — not with hope but with a kind of reverent, cataloged despair. *Sin remedio.* Without remedy — the diagnosis and the prognosis in two words.

Kathleen was wonderful. Kathleen was funny and kind and she showed up and she held his hand and she laughed at his jokes even when they weren't funny and she was, he sometimes thought, exactly what he deserved — which was a terrible thing to think about someone you were supposed to love, and he knew it, and he thought it anyway. Kathleen had big brown eyes and a round sweet face and a body he tried to want the way he wanted Persefoni's — he'd focus on her eyes, on the curve of her hips, and tell himself this was enough, this was real, this was what attraction felt like when it was healthy and not a sickness. With Kathleen, wanting her was a choice he made every day. With Persefoni, it was involuntary, like breathing, like blinking, like the way your eyes find the brightest thing in a dark room. Kathleen was the stars. Reliable, beautiful, always there.

Persefoni was the northern lights.

There was a Josh Ritter song. "Kathleen." He played it for Kathleen on his guitar and she loved it — *of course* she loved it, it was called "Kathleen," it was her song, he played it for her and she leaned into him and closed her eyes and he could see it on her face: she thought he was singing about her. "All the other girls here are stars, you are the northern lights." and Alejandro would sing it looking at the fretboard so he didn't have to look at Kathleen's face, because the song wasn't about the girl whose name it carried. It was about the girl in the shadows you can't stop watching. The one so far beyond you that all you can do is save her the passenger seat and hope.

He put the thought in a drawer. The drawer didn't close all the way anymore — it hadn't for months — but he leaned on it until it clicked. *Ya.* Enough. He went back to thinking about attention.

---

Rosemary was in the passenger seat, scrolling through her photos from Stonehenge, which she'd been doing since they left the parking lot. Periodically she'd hold the phone up to George: "Look at this one!" George would glance over and say "Beautiful, baby" and Rosemary would beam and go back to scrolling. She'd taken maybe two hundred photos. She would post all of them.

The back seat was chaos.

It was too small for three people, even three teenagers. Kathleen was in the middle, her knees angled toward Alejandro, her shoulder pressed against his. Persefoni was behind Rosemary with one leg tucked under her and the other stretched into Kathleen's space, her bare foot resting on Kathleen's thigh like it belonged there. Alejandro was behind George, wedged against the door, acutely aware of the geometry — Kathleen warm against his left side, Persefoni two feet away and filling the car the way her father filled it, effortlessly, like the air bent toward her. And Sheepey — the stuffed sheep they'd bought at Stonehenge, three inches tall, black wool, a face like a small ruined aristocrat — was propped between the two girls, who were currently discussing his personal life.

"The thing about Tabitha," Persefoni was saying, in the British accent that had been going for an hour now, "is that she never appreciated what she had. She had a man of distinction. A man of *Stone-henge.* And she threw it all away for a goat farmer."

"To be fair," Kathleen said, also British, "the goat farmer had land."

"Everyone has land in Devon, Kathleen. That's the whole problem with Devon."

"What's the problem with Devon?"

"Too much land. Not enough character. Sheepey had character."

"Sheepey lost three estates."

"He lost them with *dignity.*"

Alejandro was smiling. He was always smiling when Persefoni did this — the voice work, the character building, the way she could spin a world out of nothing and make you believe it was real while knowing it wasn't. It was, if he had to classify it — and he always had to classify it — a form of spontaneous mythopoesis. The creation of myth in real time. *Cómo lo hace.* How does she do it — the question arriving in Spanish before the classification could catch it. She didn't plan Sheepey's backstory. She didn't outline it. She opened her mouth and the story was there, fully formed, as if she'd simply remembered something that had always been true.

He had a word for what she was doing. Several words, actually. He could talk about narrative cognition, about the right hemisphere's capacity for implicit meaning-making, about the relationship between play and the generation of symbolic structures. He could be very precise about what Persefoni was doing.

What he couldn't do was do it himself.

If Alejandro tried to invent Sheepey, Sheepey would have a backstory that was architecturally sound and emotionally inert. Sheepey would have a coherent timeline and a thematic throughline and nobody would laugh. The structure would be there. The life wouldn't. He knew this about himself the way he knew most uncomfortable things — clearly, technically, with full awareness of the gap between diagnosis and cure.

Persefoni caught him watching her. She did this sometimes — looked up mid-bit, mid-laugh, and caught his eyes on her, and something would cross her face that he couldn't classify. Not discomfort. Not pleasure. Something closer to a flinch — quick, barely there, like she'd brushed against something she didn't want to touch.

"What?" she said. But she said it the way you say *what* when you already know the answer and you need the other person to say *nothing.* She said it like a door she was holding shut.

"Nothing," he said.

"Good." She turned back to Kathleen, back to Sheepey, and picked up the bit exactly where she'd left it — "Anyway, the yacht was called the *Duchess of Shropshire*" — without missing a beat, without a seam, as if the last three seconds hadn't happened at all.

Kathleen laughed at the Duchess of Shropshire. But her eyes moved — just for a half second, a flick — from Persefoni to Alejandro and back again, the way you glance at a door you thought you heard open. She seemed to have missed what started it. She almost always seemed to. But she'd caught the shape of something — the "what," the "nothing," the "good" — and Alejandro watched her face do a thing he'd seen it do before: a small tightening around the mouth, her lower lip pulling in like she was biting the inside of it, and then her eyes went bright again — too bright, too fast, the way a light comes on in a room where someone just left. He knew that decision. He'd watched her make it before — not often, but enough. Every boy at school looked at Persefoni. That had never bothered Kathleen, as far as Alejandro could tell. She'd roll her eyes at it, laugh about it, treat it the way you treat weather. But sometimes — at a lunch table, in a hallway, once at a party when he'd lost track of himself and stared too long — Kathleen would catch *him* looking, and her face would do this different thing. Not the eye-roll. Not the laugh. This quiet tightening, this brief arrival at something that scared her, and then the retreat — fast, practiced, the same muscle every time.

Kathleen squeezed his hand — the same hand she'd been holding for the last hour — and jumped into the bit: "The *Duchess of Shropshire*? That's a terrible name for a yacht."

"It was a terrible yacht," Persefoni said. "That's rather the point."

And just like that, Kathleen was back in, and the game was theirs again, and whatever she'd almost seen was gone — or looked gone, which Alejandro suspected was the same thing to Kathleen, or close enough.

Alejandro understood, in the precise and clinical way he understood most things that hurt, what had just happened — what both of them had just done. Persefoni had seen him looking. She had to know what it meant, he thought — she'd been deflecting it too precisely, for too long, for it to be accidental. And she'd chosen, or seemed to have chosen, not to know. Not for his sake, he thought. For Kathleen's. Because Kathleen was sitting between them with her hand in his, and Kathleen talked about their wedding sometimes, casually, like it was already scheduled, and whatever Persefoni felt about any of this, the one thing Alejandro was certain of was that she would never let it touch Kathleen. She would smother whatever this was in its crib every single time, and she would do it so gracefully that Kathleen would never have to see it.

He admired this. He hated it. He filed both feelings in the drawer that didn't close anymore.

"He's writing a song about you," Kathleen said, squeezing Alejandro's hand. "It's called 'The Girl Who Wouldn't Shut Up About Sheep.'"

"That's actually a great title," Persefoni said. "You should use that. I want a writing credit."

Kathleen laughed. Persefoni laughed. And the moment was gone — not passed, not faded, but actively killed by Persefoni and buried so cleanly that only Alejandro knew there had been a body.

The English countryside was doing that thing the English countryside does — being so green it looked fake, like someone had adjusted the saturation and forgotten to stop. Stone walls divided the fields into irregular patches under a sky so blue it looked theoretical. Sheep dotted the hillsides like the ones at Stonehenge, unbothered, unimpressed by the beauty they were standing in the middle of. The wind was moving across the fields in long visible waves — you could see it in the grass, the way it bent and recovered, bent and recovered, never grabbing anything, never holding on. It just moved through. Alejandro watched the sheep through the window and thought about the relationship between an organism and its environment — how they had no aesthetic experience of the landscape, no concept of their own beauty within it, no narrative about themselves at all. Present. Attending to the grass.

That was the Master. That was what McGilchrist was talking about. The mode of attention that precedes classification. Before the word *sheep*, before the word *green*, before any label at all — there's just the seeing. The raw encounter with the thing itself.

He was going to try to explain this to Kathleen later and she was going to smile and nod.

He already knew this. She'd smile, he was certain, because she loved him and she wanted to love the things he loved, and she'd nod because nodding was what you did when someone you cared about was excited and you couldn't follow them where they were going. He'd lose her in the second sentence. She'd start watching his face instead of listening to his words — tracking his excitement rather than its source — and afterward she'd say something like "that's really cool, babe" and mean it, and it would land in him like a coin dropped into a well so deep you never hear it hit.

Persefoni, though. Persefoni would get it. She always got it — not the framework, not the terminology, but the thing underneath. She'd say something offhand, something that wasn't even trying to be brilliant, and it would be the exact image he'd been laboring toward for weeks. She did this to him constantly. He'd spend hours constructing a careful explanation and she'd skip the explanation entirely and arrive at the destination before him, barefoot, like she'd always lived there. It was the most attractive and the most devastating thing about her — that the territory he was immigrating to was her native country, and she didn't even know it was remarkable.

He'd been working on it. The king and the servant. The master sending the emissary to manage the lands. The emissary forgetting, growing certain, locking the master away. He'd written it out three different ways in his notebook. The first version was too technical. The second was too long. The third was close — close enough that he could feel the shape of it, the way you can feel a word on the tip of your tongue — but it wasn't there yet.

Tomorrow. McGilchrist was speaking tomorrow. And maybe hearing it from the source would give him what he needed — not the argument but the *feeling* of the argument, the thing that lived under the words, the thing that made the book feel less like an academic treatise and more like a warning. An ancient story about something happening right now, to everyone, all the time, and nobody could see it because the thing preventing them from seeing it was the same thing they were using to look.

The servant was running the kingdom. And everyone thought the servant was the king.

"We're getting close!" George announced from the front seat, and Rosemary immediately started taking photos of the road.

"George, that's just a field."

"It's a Welsh field, baby. That's different."

"How is it different?"

"It's got more character. Like Sheep-EYE."

"Oh my God, Dad," Persefoni said. "Don't encourage her."

"Sheepey is Welsh?" Kathleen said.

"Sheepey is from Stone-*henge*," Persefoni corrected, British accent back at full power. "Which is in *Wiltshire.* Very different from Wales. The Welsh wouldn't have him. He owes money in Cardiff."

"How much?"

"An ungentlemanly amount."

Hay-on-Wye appeared around a bend — the town built into the hillside, the castle visible above the rooftops, the festival tents spread across the fields below. Alejandro felt something in his chest he could identify precisely — anticipatory arousal, elevated heart rate, a release of dopamine in response to proximity to a desired stimulus — and also something he couldn't identify at all, which was just: he was fifteen years old and the man who had rearranged his brain was somewhere in that town, and tomorrow he was going to hear him speak, and that mattered in a way that didn't fit inside any classification system he had.

"Are those *yurts*?" Kathleen said, draping herself over Alejandro's shoulders and leaning across his lap to see out his window. The angle of her body made a curtain between them and the front seat, and beneath it her hand found him — not his thigh, not close to, but *him* — and her fingers closed with the quiet certainty of someone who had been thinking about this for a while. His whole body answered before his mind could object — *Dios* — a sudden urgent syllable in a language he hadn't known he was fluent in. She didn't look at him. She was looking at the yurts. She was asking about yurts. And her hand was holding a conversation his brain couldn't keep up with. From the other side of the back seat, Persefoni was looking out her own window. Or had been. He caught her eyes for half a second — she'd seen, or could see, the geometry was obvious from her angle — and she looked away first, back to the fields, her face perfectly neutral in a way that was itself a kind of statement.

They were yurts. A whole field of them — maybe fifty, white canvas with round wooden doors, spread across a hillside like mushrooms after rain. George had booked two, side by side — one for the adults, one for the kids. Because of course George had. George handled everything.

George parked the car. Everyone piled out. Persefoni saw the castle first — up on the hill above the town, stone and ivy and a broken tower against the sky — and her whole face changed. "We have to go up there," she said, to no one in particular, with the quiet certainty of someone who had just fallen in love at first sight. Rosemary was already taking photos of the yurts. George was already talking to someone — a festival volunteer, a stranger, it didn't matter, George would be friends with them in thirty seconds. Kathleen was looking at the castle too, but Persefoni had already moved on — holding Sheepey up to the yurt door, narrating his reaction to Kathleen: "He thinks it's a bit rustic. He had a yurt once, in Bruges. Lost it in a card game."

The inside was nicer than Alejandro's bedroom. The canvas walls curved up to a wooden crown at the center where the support poles met, and the late afternoon light came through the fabric soft and warm, turning everything the color of honey. A little cast-iron wood stove sat near the entrance with a neat stack of firewood beside it and a box of matches on top. Fur rugs covered the floor — thick, overlapping, the kind of thing you wanted to take your shoes off for. Two queen beds sat on opposite sides of the yurt, maybe six feet apart, each one piled with a down comforter so thick it looked like it was rising, white against the dark fur and the warm canvas. Between the beds, a low wooden table with a lantern on it. The whole place smelled like woodsmoke and wool and something sweet Alejandro couldn't identify — beeswax, maybe, or the canvas itself.

"We get the one on the left," Persefoni said, dropping her bag on it and pulling Kathleen by the wrist.

"They're the same," Alejandro said.

"The one on the left has better energy."

"That's not — that doesn't — " He stopped. She was grinning at him. She knew exactly what she was doing. She was poking the part of him that needed to classify everything, and she found it funny, and he found it funny that she found it funny, and for a moment the drawer opened and the thought he kept inside it was very close to the surface.

He closed it.

"Fine," he said. "I'll take the one on the right."

Nobody had even discussed the arrangement. The girls took one bed, Alejandro got the other, and that was that — assumed the way weather is assumed. To George and Rosemary he was the boy who read too much and forgot to eat lunch. He could see it in the way George clapped him on the shoulder and said "you kids have fun" without a flicker of hesitation, the way Rosemary kissed all three of them on the forehead before ducking into the yurt next door with its king bed. They were kids. Just kids. That was all George and Rosemary needed to know.

Alejandro sat on his bed and watched Persefoni and Kathleen test theirs — bouncing on it, pulling the comforter up to their chins, Kathleen shrieking that it was the best bed she'd ever been in, Persefoni informing Kathleen in her British accent that Sheepey had once owned a bed like this but lost it in a duel. The lantern light caught Persefoni's curls and turned them copper and Kathleen's big eyes were bright with laughing and Alejandro thought: *spontaneous mythopoesis.* And then he thought — the thought arriving in his first language before his second could catch it — *ella lo hace real.* She makes things real just by talking about them.

Better. Still not right.

He pulled his notebook out of his bag. Outside, the light had gone blue — that cold particular shade of dusk where the sky forgets it was ever warm — and he could hear George's laugh carrying across the field, and someone playing guitar somewhere, and the wind moving through the canvas walls like breathing. Tomorrow McGilchrist would speak, and Alejandro would be in the room, and maybe he'd finally find the image that turned understanding into feeling. The one that would make someone go *oh.*

He opened to a blank page and started writing. He didn't find it that night. But he got closer.

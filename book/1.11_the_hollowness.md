She woke up in the wrong color.

Blue. Not the red-gold of her fairy lights, not the warm amber of her bedroom where the curtains caught the morning and turned everything the color of honey. Blue — the flat, cold blue of monitors that never slept, the blue of a room that existed for sound and nothing else, the blue of his color washing over her skin and turning the golden brown into something she didn't recognize. She knew where she was before she opened her eyes. The pillow smelled like cable insulation and laptop heat. The loop station was still humming — she could feel it in the mattress, the vibration of a machine that hadn't been turned off, "Stone-HENGE" still loaded, the sheep choir cycling at a volume below hearing, a murmur in the hardware, *don't put me back* repeating to nobody.

The bed was wrong. Not wrong like dangerous — wrong like a word used in the right sentence but the wrong language. She could feel him beside her. Not touching, but close enough that the warmth of him reached her, and the warmth was tender, and the tenderness was arriving before she was ready for it, and she was not ready for it. She could feel him watching. The careful, steady weight of his attention — the way he looked at everything he wanted to understand, except now the everything was her — and the watching was love, his kind of love, and she knew this, and knowing it didn't help.

She lay still and let the morning catch up to her body.

Last night. The song. The being-seen — the most total seeing she'd experienced since before the fame, since before the pressed flower, since before ten million strangers started describing her and the description swallowed the person. He'd handed her back the part of herself the internet couldn't find. *You breathe things alive.* And the seeing was so enormous and so physical that her body couldn't tell the difference between being known and being held and the gap between them closed and she hadn't stopped him. She hadn't stopped him because stopping him would have required her to be somewhere the being-known wasn't, and the being-known was everywhere, and her body was lonely and his hands were there and the loneliness overwhelmed her body before her mind could intervene.

Her mind was intervening now.

She was not in love. She was in the aftermath. The song had happened to her body and her body had responded and now her mind was arriving at the scene and what it was arriving at was this: she didn't choose this. She was lonely and he was the only person who could see her and the seeing overwhelmed her and now she was in his bed and the blue light was on her skin and she could feel him building the story already — the love story, the origin myth, the version where this was something she chose — and she couldn't correct it because correcting it would mean being alone, and alone was the one thing she could not survive right now.

She sat up. Found her shoes.

"I should go," she said.

"My parents."

The walk home through the side door, into the smoke. The fires had been burning for days — the sky was still that deep, bruised orange, the air thick enough to taste, the ash on the lawn like a dusting of dirty snow. She pulled her mask up and walked with her hood on and her hands in her pockets and the smoke pressed against her face the way it had pressed against it every day that week, the taste of char on her tongue, the streetlights still haloed at 7 AM because the air wouldn't let the light through clean. She carried something she couldn't name yet. Not regret exactly. Something more like the feeling of having been translated into someone else's language without being asked.

She was halfway home when her phone buzzed.

*I told Kathleen.*

Three words. A period. And the floor dropped out.

---

She stood on the sidewalk and read the text again. *I told Kathleen.* The words sat on her screen like the conclusion of a proof she was never shown. She'd never been in the hallway. She arrived at a wall where a door used to be and the wall was already built and the builder was the boy she'd just left in a bed that smelled like cable insulation and she never got to say anything — never got to shape the telling, to be in the room when the bomb went off, to say her version. To say: I was lonely and you saw me and the seeing overwhelmed me and my body responded before my mind could intervene and it was not what you told her it was.

He told his version. She could feel the shape of it in those three words — the period at the end, the precision, the satisfaction of a thing completed. *We both felt it.* His reading, not hers. *It's been building.* His narrative imposed on months of creative partnership that felt different from her side. *I respect you too much to lie.* Making him the hero of a story about integrity when the real story was a boy who wanted a girl so badly he read her overwhelm as desire and announced it as fact.

She saw through it immediately. She saw the way he'd turned a misread into a proof, the way his version made his version feel inevitable, the way *I respect you too much to lie* made the telling a gift and the teller a hero and the girl who had just woken up in the wrong color into a person who had chosen something she hadn't chosen.

She was claimed, not met.

And she could not correct it. Correcting it would mean saying what actually happened, and what actually happened was: I was lonely and you were there and I am not in love with you. And saying that would mean being alone. And being alone, right now, with the smoke choking the valley and Kathleen's door already shut and the fame pressing in from every direction — being alone was the one thing she could not be.

She walked home. She climbed through the window. She lay on her bed in the red-gold of the fairy lights and she picked up her phone and she called Kathleen.

It rang. It rang. It rang. Nobody answered.

---

She texted. *Kathleen please call me.*

She texted again. *I'm so sorry.*

She texted again. *Please.*

She drafted a long message — three paragraphs, explaining, the words tumbling out of her thumbs with the desperation of a girl trying to build a hallway to a door that was already a wall. She read it back. She deleted it. She wrote a shorter one. *Can we talk.* She sent it. The blue check marks appeared — delivered, read — and the reading was worse than the silence because the reading meant Kathleen was there, Kathleen was on the other side of the screen, Kathleen's big round eyes were looking at the words and the words were not enough and the looking produced nothing. No response. No exclamation marks. No heart emoji. No *what the fuck, Persefoni.* A fight would have been better. A fight has two people in the room. Screaming, tears, accusations — at least those are sounds. At least those are contact. This was one person in the room and one person gone, and the gone person left because of something real and true and unfixable, and the person left behind couldn't even say *I know* because saying *I know* requires someone to say it to.

She held the phone. The holding was the loneliest thing she'd ever done — lonelier than the fame, lonelier than the pressed flower, lonelier than the bathroom floor at 2 AM reading comments from strangers. Because this loneliness was earned.

Outside the window, the sky was the color of a bruise.

---

It had come on the Monday before — Labor Day, the fires eating their way west, the smoke arriving before anyone understood what was happening. She'd woken up that first morning and the light in her room was wrong — not the soft September morning light, but something amber and thick, like looking through a jar of honey that had gone bad. She'd pulled back the curtain and the sky was brown. Not cloud-brown. Not overcast. A deep, dirty brown, the color of something that used to be a forest, ash and smoke arriving from somewhere she would never go, settling on everything, belonging to nothing.

By Tuesday the brown was orange. By Wednesday the orange was red.

Not sunset red. Not firelight red. Not the red-gold of her curls in lantern light, not the warmth of the yurt, not the color of anything she associated with comfort or home. This was a different red — older, angrier, the red of a world before language, the red of a sky that had stopped pretending to be a sky and was showing you what it looked like when the air itself was fuel. The sun was a dim disc she could stare at directly, and staring at it felt like looking at something injured. AQI 500+. Off the charts. The measurement system running out of words for how poisoned the air was.

Ash fell like snow. It collected on windshields and porches and the lawn she used to cross at midnight. It settled on the patio table where George would grill in two months, and on the mailbox, and on the branch of the maple in the front yard where a bird was supposed to be sitting and wasn't, because the birds were gone, the birds had left or died or hidden somewhere the smoke couldn't reach, and the silence of a neighborhood without birds was a silence she hadn't known existed until it did.

Can't open windows. Can't go outside. COVID lockdown plus smoke lockdown. The world she'd been sealed inside for six months found a new seal — not a governor's order but the atmosphere itself, the planet saying *stay inside* in a voice that smelled like char and tasted like the end of something. And this — this week, this apocalypse, this sky the color of a bruise that wouldn't heal — was when she lost Kathleen.

The fires were her personal hell. She knew it. She broke the thing she loved most and the sky turned the color of what she did. Red — but wrong red, not warmth, not firelight, not the red-gold of anything she loved. This red was heat become suffocation. She couldn't breathe outside because the smoke. She couldn't breathe inside because the guilt. She was sealed in a house with parents who didn't see her — George narrating, Rosemary watching — sealed away from the friend who wouldn't answer, sealed into a thing with a boy she didn't choose. And the sky was the color of a wound and the ash settled on everything and the air itself was trying to kill her.

The smoke got in through the cracks. The old windows didn't seal right. Her room smelled like campfire by the third day — the smoke finding every gap in the weatherstripping, every imperfection in the frame, creeping in the way guilt creeps in, through the places you thought were solid, through the seams you didn't know you had.

The guilt got in through the cracks too.

---

She went to Alejandro's.

Not because she wanted to. Because she had nowhere else to go. And because the smoke gave her a reason that wasn't the real reason.

"I can't breathe at my house."

True. The air in her house was bad — the old windows, the smoke creeping in, her room smelling like something that had burned. His studio had an air purifier. A HEPA filter humming in the corner — his parents had bought it the first day the AQI hit 300. She could breathe in his room. She could breathe in his blue light. The smoke gave her permission to go to the only place she was going to go anyway — and the permission mattered because without it she'd have to say *I need you* and she couldn't say that because *I need you* is not the same as *I want you* and the gap between those two things was the entire foundation of a thing she couldn't afford to examine.

His studio. His blue light. His careful hands. He was tender. He was devoted. He touched her hair the way you'd touch something precious and fragile — gently, too gently, with a care that felt more like study than warmth. He thought this was the beginning of something. She knew it was the wreckage of something else, but she couldn't tell him that because telling him would mean being alone, and alone was the one thing she could not be right now.

She let him hold her. She let him think this was love. She participated in being loved. Because the alternative — correcting his reading, naming the misread, saying *I was lonely and you were there* — would capsize the only boat in the water. Outside, the ash fell. Inside, the HEPA filter hummed. The air in this room was the cleanest air available to her, and the relationship in this room was the only relationship available to her, and both of those things were true, and neither of them was love.

He said things about Kathleen. Analgesic things. "She'll be okay." "Give her time." "You didn't do anything wrong."

Every one of those sentences was a tiny lie she accepted because the truth — *I DID do something wrong, and the wrong thing was you, and I'm here because I have nowhere else to be* — would leave her with nothing.

He wasn't bad to her. He was attentive, thoughtful, present in his way. He played her new music. He talked about McGilchrist. He noticed things about her that nobody else noticed and named them with a precision that should have felt like love. And she felt cared for. Not unloved. Not mistreated. Just — appreciated. Expertly, thoroughly appreciated. But being appreciated is not the same as being met. Being met was Kathleen on the bed, cross-legged, saying *do it again* without knowing why. Being appreciated was Alejandro explaining why.

The terror: if she told the truth, she lost him too. And then she had nobody. The fame didn't count. The followers didn't count. George and Rosemary didn't count — George was narrating her story as his story, Rosemary was watching with an instinct she couldn't put words to. Without Alejandro, Persefoni was a girl in a room with ten million people and not a single person who knew her. And the room was full of smoke.

---

The smoke cleared on September 26th. The AQI dropped below 100 for the first time in three weeks. The windows opened. The air moved through the house for the first time since Labor Day — clean air, real air, air that didn't burn. She stood at her bedroom window and breathed in and the breathing was easy and the ease changed nothing.

She was still suffocating.

That was when she knew. The smoke was never the problem. The smoke was the world being honest about how she felt, and now the world had stopped being honest, and she was still choking on something nobody else could see. The sky was blue again — September blue, high and clean and indifferent — and the clean sky made the suffocation worse because at least during the smoke she had an explanation. At least during the smoke the outside matched the inside. Now the outside was beautiful and the inside was ash and the gap between them was the loneliest thing she'd carried since the loneliness began.

She went to Alejandro's anyway. The smoke was gone but the pattern remained. His studio every day. His blue light. His HEPA filter still humming because he hadn't turned it off and wouldn't turn it off for weeks, the machine running on a threat that had passed, making itself necessary in the absence of the necessity. The air purifier solving a problem that no longer existed, and her still showing up at his door solving one that did.

---

She saw the deal clearly. She could see through every arrangement she was inside of, even while she was inside it, and the seeing didn't help because seeing through a life raft doesn't make you any less wet.

The deal: he provided the strategy that made her money. She provided the presence that let him believe he was loved. He was brilliant — he'd turned "Stone-HENGE" from a lockdown reel into a platform, turned Sheepey from a private joke into a brand, mapped her Instagram analytics, optimized her engagement metrics, built her content calendar. Every strategic decision he made was correct, and every correct decision made her richer. She was a millionaire because of his mind. She knew it.

He wanted her. Not cruelly — he'd never frame it that way — but he wanted the relationship, the closeness, the love story he'd been building in his head since the song. He wanted the sex to happen again. He wanted what he thought the night meant.

It happened once. The Stone-HENGE night. It was never happening again. She knew this the morning after — walking home through the smoke haze, she already knew. The sex was the consequence of the song, of the being-seen, of the loneliness overwhelming her body before her mind could intervene. It was not the beginning of something. It was the end of a night. And when the sky turned red and the smoke sealed them in and the world became hell, it was as if the apocalypse arrived to confirm what she already felt: that night was a rupture, and the fires were the world telling her so. When the smoke cleared, she disowned it. All of it. The sex, the physical closeness, the pretense that this was ever a relationship of the body. As if hell had landed on earth and caused the betrayal and when hell receded she disowned it. She kept the lifeline. She dropped the lie.

But she could see it on him — the way he moved around her, the ease in his body, the settled look of a boy who believed he'd arrived somewhere. He acted like they were in a relationship. Like the night was a beginning. She could feel him waiting for the physical part to resume — the patience radiating off him like heat, the patience of a boy who had decided the waiting itself was proof of depth. She could see the story he'd built for the waiting: she was grieving, she needed time, things would deepen when she was ready. She could see it because Alejandro wore his stories the way other people wore clothes — visibly, completely, without knowing they were visible. The story was elegant and completely wrong.

---

What followed was months of his wanting and her redirecting.

She never said no. She never gave an excuse. She just wasn't there when the moment arrived. He reached for her and she was already showing him something on her phone — "look at this comment, this is insane." He reached for her and she was suddenly mid-idea, talking fast, pulling him into a content strategy question that his brain couldn't resist answering. He reached for her and she asked him to play that thing he was working on, the one with the cello sample, and his hands went to the mixing board instead. He reached for her and she said something so funny he forgot what he was reaching for.

She never closed the door. She just opened a different one — every time, effortlessly, so smoothly he didn't realize he'd been redirected until the moment had passed. Classic Persefoni: she didn't manage the situation with excuses. She managed it with attention — moving his, directing it somewhere else, giving him something better to think about than the thing she was withholding.

He never brought it up. He couldn't. He was too infatuated, too aware that she was Persefoni and he was the kid with the loop station who couldn't believe she was in his room. He just tried — small, unspoken, physical angles at intimacy. A hand on her lower back. Leaning in. Brushing her hair behind her ear. Each one a question he was too afraid to ask out loud, and each one she redirected so smoothly that he pulled back with the look of a kid who'd just been gently told no without anyone saying the word. The tightening around his mouth. The hands going to the mixing board instead. The explanations getting louder as his body got quieter.

The frustration accumulated in the room like the smoke had accumulated in the valley: invisible at first, then hazy, then hard to breathe through. But neither of them named it. He wouldn't because he was afraid the answer was no. She wouldn't because the answer *was* no and saying it would end the arrangement.

He thought they were in a love story with a slow physical start. She knew there was no love story. There was a girl in a room with a boy who made her money and wanted her body, and she was giving him the first and withholding the second, and the withholding was the most honest thing about her.

---

Sheepey went quiet.

Not a decision — an inability. The character was always a duet. Persefoni narrating what Sheepey thought, Kathleen as the straight man pushing back. *"He doesn't approve." "Of what?" "Of any of this, Kathleen."* The architecture of the bit required two people talking about him and there was one person and an empty chair.

She caught herself almost doing it — something would happen, a small absurdity, and a Sheepey story would rise in her like a reflex, something about the time he got lost in Salisbury or his complicated feelings about Victorian horse breeds or the evening he'd spent at a pub near Bath arguing with a terrier about the proper temperature for ale — and she'd stop. Because the story needed Kathleen to hear it. The story had no audience. Telling a Sheepey story to nobody was a monologue, and Sheepey was never a monologue. Sheepey was a conversation between two girls about a stuffed sheep's ridiculous life, and the other girl was gone.

Alejandro noticed the absence. He loved Sheepey — thought the character was brilliant — but he couldn't do the bit himself because improvisation wasn't his gift. He could explain why the comedy worked, take it apart and show you the pieces, tell you exactly where the dignity cracked and why the crack was funny. But he couldn't riff. That was always Persefoni and Kathleen's territory — the place where play lived, where the making happened before the explaining, where you had to be fast and loose and wrong before you could be right.

Weeks passed. She filmed Instagram reels — content, engagement, the machine running — and the reels were good and the numbers climbed and the voice Alejandro had given her a platform for was working, but the voice was smaller than it used to be because the funniest part of her had lost its other half.

Then one day she was filming. A throwaway reel. Something about lockdown, some observation. And Sheepey came out.

Not planned. A story just arrived — the way they always arrived, unbidden, the character's history asserting itself. She started telling the camera about something Sheepey did, some adventure from his past, the absurd specificity of his life before she'd found him at Stonehenge — the places he'd been, the things he'd seen, the dignity he maintained despite everything. Something about a rainstorm in Bath. Something about a borrowed umbrella and a very small horse.

And she was mid-reel, mid-story, and Sheepey was *there* — his world alive, posh, absurd, funny — and for a moment the hollowness filled with something that felt almost like the real thing. She didn't stop. She kept going. The camera caught it.

She watched the playback. Sheepey was good. Sheepey was her.

But it wasn't the same. The difference between Sheepey-with-Kathleen and Sheepey-for-the-camera was invisible to anyone who'd never heard the original. It was like a cover of a song by the original artist — technically perfect, emotionally one degree off. Only someone who was in the room when the song was written would hear the difference. And the only person who was in the room didn't answer the phone anymore.

She posted it because posting was the only way to complete the circuit now — the audience on the other end, the laughter she needed, the response that used to come from Kathleen's side of the bed.

It exploded. Of course it did. Sheepey was the most Persefoni thing she'd ever put on camera — funnier than her dances, more intimate than her storytelling reels, more real than anything the brand had produced. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge bypassed every defense the audience had. Comments flooded. People wanted more. The character had an audience of millions now.

Alejandro saw the numbers and said something perfectly Alejandro — something about the character being her most authentic brand expression, about how Sheepey bypassed the parasocial barrier because the voice was so specific it couldn't be faked. He mapped the strategy. He was right. He was analytically, structurally, completely right. And being right was the problem, because Sheepey didn't need a strategy. Sheepey needed Kathleen on the bed saying *do it again* and instead Sheepey got an analytics dashboard.

---

Sheepey became a recurring feature. The character grew. The comments filled with love — strangers who felt like they knew this sheep, who quoted his lines, who made fan art, who said *Sheepey is the best thing on the internet.* Every one of those comments was a hand reaching through a screen. None of them were Kathleen's hand. A million hands and the one hand that mattered and the distance between them was the distance between being watched and being known.

Then the merch conversation. Someone — a brand deal, or Alejandro mentioned it with the casual precision of a boy who'd already modeled the revenue — suggested a Sheepey plush. A stuffed sheep. Mass-produced. The seven-dollar original from the Stonehenge gift shop, reproduced at scale. Copies. Inventory. The thing that was a family member becoming a product line.

*One sees copies. The other sees families.*

Persefoni felt something when she heard it — a flinch, a recoil, something deep and inarticulate. She couldn't explain why the idea made her sick because explaining it would require saying *Sheepey was Kathleen's too* and she couldn't say Kathleen's name without the hollowness swallowing her whole.

She didn't say no to the merch. She didn't say yes. She did what she always did — redirected. Gave Alejandro something else to think about. Opened a different door.

---

October. November. The world outside contracted and the world inside contracted with it.

Phase 1 stalled. Online school continued. Fall sports cancelled. The lockdown that was supposed to be temporary had hardened into routine — waking up in a sealed room, walking through sealed streets to another sealed room where the air was filtered and the light was blue and the boy who thought he was her boyfriend built plans for her fame.

But one thing stayed alive.

George was a huge Alabama fan. Had been his whole life — it was in the blood, it was identity, it was religion. From Alabama. Raised on it. The Crimson Tide wasn't a team but a family sacrament. And Persefoni inherited it. *Roll Tide* / *Roll Damn Tide* — the call-and-response between father and daughter that predated everything. Before fame, before Alejandro, before Kathleen, before Beaverton.

She loved watching 'Bama games with her dad. It was their thing. Every game since she was eleven, she wore the same shirt — a cartoon elephant 'Bama tee, faded and soft and too small now, the kind of shirt you'd never post on Instagram because it belonged to the version of you that existed before the camera. She put it on without thinking. Muscle memory. Home.

The 2020 season started late because of COVID — SEC played conference-only, first game September 26th. The smoke had just cleared. The AQI had dropped below 100 for the first time in three weeks. The windows were open. George had wings and his Crimson Tide blanket and he was on the couch and Persefoni came downstairs in the elephant shirt and he said "Roll Tide" and she said "Roll Damn Tide" and for the first time in weeks she felt something that wasn't the hollowness.

'Bama won easy. Missouri, 38-19. The season had begun.

The games kept coming. Texas A&M 52-24. Ole Miss 63-48 — a wild shootout that had George screaming, his big voice filling the house, rattling the dishes Rosemary had just cleaned. And by the third game George was saying it — the thing the announcers were saying, the thing everyone was saying: "You watching this kid? This *freshman?*" Démion Reyes. The name was everywhere suddenly — the freshman quarterback who moved like nothing anyone had ever seen, who threw like he already knew where the receiver would be before the receiver knew, who ran like a man that size had no business running. George kept shaking his head. "That boy is *different.*"

And Persefoni noticed him. She noticed him the way she noticed everything — immediately, physically, before the noticing had a name. The camera found him and she felt something rearrange in her attention. Not a thought. A sensation. The size of him. The way he moved inside his body like his body was a place he liked being. The arms. She noticed the arms.

She didn't say anything. She watched the game with her dad and she didn't say anything.

Georgia 41-24. Tennessee 48-17. Mississippi State 41-0, a shutout on Halloween. Each Saturday the same ritual: elephant shirt, couch, George, wings, *Roll Tide* / *Roll Damn Tide.* The games were the heartbeat of the collapse. Everything else was contracting — the lockdown, the hollowness, the life raft, the guilt — but the games expanded. George was the happiest version of himself on those Saturdays, and his happiness was uncomplicated in a way nothing else in Persefoni's life was uncomplicated, and she soaked in it. And each Saturday the camera found Démion and each Saturday she felt the same thing rearrange and each Saturday she didn't say anything about it.

---

November 7th. Her birthday. Bye week — no game.

She turned eighteen. George made it an event. He grilled even though it was November, standing on the back patio in his Intel jacket with the charcoal going, narrating the occasion the way he narrated everything: "My baby girl is eighteen. Legal. A grown woman." He said it like he was hosting a show. The deep voice, the Southern warmth, the pride that sounded like love and functioned as ownership.

Rosemary made a cake. Not from a box — a real one. The kind she used to make before everything got busy. Three layers. The frosting not quite even, the effort visible in the unevenness, the mother trying with her hands because she didn't have the words. Rosemary's hands, working the icing, the concentration on her face — Persefoni watched her and felt something she couldn't name. Something about effort. Something about the distance between what Rosemary wanted to say and what Rosemary knew how to say and how the cake was supposed to bridge it.

Alejandro brought flowers. Of course he brought flowers. He was being perfect. He was being Alejandro.

The gathering was small because it had to be — six people max, two households, the rules George followed to the letter because George followed rules. So it was just the four of them, and the mandated smallness would have been cozy if it were chosen, but it wasn't chosen, it was mandated, and the mandated smallness put the real smallness in sharp relief.

Kathleen was not here.

Kathleen would have been here. Kathleen would have brought something ridiculous — a card with too many exclamation marks, a gift from the dollar store wrapped in newspaper, something that cost nothing and meant everything. The chair Alejandro was sitting in was not Alejandro's chair. It was Kathleen-empty. He'd brought flowers and he was being perfect and the chair was still Kathleen-empty and Persefoni could feel the shape of the absence the way you feel a missing tooth with your tongue — by pressing against the gap, by the sudden nothing where something solid used to be.

George gave a toast. He stood at the head of the table and held his glass and his voice went warm and Southern and performative — "My baby girl" this and "My baby girl" that — and Persefoni watched him narrate her birthday the way he narrated everything, the way he narrated Rosemary on his arm, the way he narrated the pandemic and the house and the family and the life, all of it turned into a story where he was the host and the audience and the main character. He loved her. She never doubted it. He just loved her loudly, the way he loved everything, and the loudness filled the room and Rosemary sat next to him with wet eyes and a three-layer cake and said nothing because George was talking and when George was talking there was no room for anything quieter.

Persefoni blew out the candles and the wish she made was not something she'd say out loud.

She was eighteen and a millionaire and famous and her mother had made her a cake and her father had grilled in November and Alejandro had brought flowers and the absence at the table was louder than all of it.

November 18th. Brown ordered the freeze — the most restrictive measures since March. Restaurants back to takeout only. Social gatherings limited to six people from no more than two households. Thanksgiving with six people max. Going backwards. The feeling of losing ground you never gained.

But on November 21st, Kentucky 63-3. And on November 28th — the Iron Bowl. Auburn. The only game that mattered more than the others. Alabama 42, Auburn 13. George was incandescent. *Roll Tide* / *Roll Damn Tide* echoing through the house, his voice so big it vibrated in her ribs, and she screamed with him and the screaming felt like the only honest sound she'd made in weeks. They were going to the SEC Championship. The season was perfect. In the middle of the freeze, in the middle of everything contracting, 'Bama was undefeated and George was the happiest man alive and Persefoni was in the elephant shirt and the world made sense for three hours at a time.

And the watching had changed. She wasn't just noticing anymore — she was looking for him. Before the snap, during the replays, on the sideline when the camera drifted. The way he dropped back and surveyed the field like he already knew. The way 250 pounds moved like something that big shouldn't be able to move. She caught herself leaning forward when he scrambled and sat back and hoped George hadn't seen it. She didn't mention this to anyone.

December. Extreme Risk tier. BSD announced remote through February. First vaccines arrived but teenagers were nowhere near the line. LSU 55-17. Arkansas 52-3.

Then the SEC Championship — December 19th. Alabama 52, Florida 46.

The greatest game of the season. A shootout. George on his feet for the entire fourth quarter, Persefoni next to him screaming. The three of them in the living room — Rosemary on the other end of the couch, watching because George was watching, the way she did everything George did — and the game was close and it was the most alive she'd felt since September and the quarterback — Démion Reyes, she knew his name now, she'd known it for weeks — threw the go-ahead touchdown and flashed that smile and something turned over in her chest that had nothing to do with the score.

January 1st. Rose Bowl. Notre Dame. Alabama 31, Notre Dame 14. Not close. They were going to the Championship. George was transcendent. He called his brother in Alabama. He called his friends. *Roll Tide* / *Roll Damn Tide* — the phrase leaving the living room and entering the phone lines, the network of Black men from Alabama who'd been waiting for this since August. Persefoni listened to her father being purely, simply happy and she loved him so much it hurt and she was wearing the elephant shirt and Démion Reyes had thrown four touchdowns and she watched every single one with something in her body that was not football.

January 11th. The Championship. Alabama versus Ohio State in Miami.

George had been talking about this game for weeks. Tonight he was on the couch with his Crimson Tide blanket and a plate of wings and he was practically vibrating. Persefoni was next to him in the elephant shirt, feet tucked under her. Alejandro was not here. Alejandro didn't do football. Alejandro didn't understand this — the couch, the blanket, the elephant shirt, the call-and-response, the father and daughter being simply, uncomplicatedly together inside something that predated everything. This was the one room Alejandro couldn't enter. Not because he was excluded — because he didn't have the language. He'd need to take it apart and understand it before he could feel it, and by the time he'd finished understanding the game would be over.

And from the first snap she couldn't stop looking at Démion.

Not the way George was looking — George was looking at dominance, at a system executing, at a player who seemed to know what the defense would do before they did it, who improvised at a level nobody had ever seen, who ran like a man that size had no right to run. George was in love — the way men fall in love with the man who brings glory to their team, the love that is uncomplicated and pure and total, the way George kept saying "Look at this kid, look at this *kid*" and slapping the armrest.

Persefoni was looking at something else.

She was looking at his arms. She was looking at his ass when he dropped back. She was looking at that smile — the one he flashed after a touchdown, the one the camera found because the camera always found it, the grin that said *I knew this would happen.* He was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. 6'6", 250 pounds, moving like something that size shouldn't be able to move, and every time the camera caught his face she felt something in her body that she hadn't felt in months — maybe hadn't felt ever, not like this, not this involuntary, not this physical.

Father and daughter on the same couch, transfixed by the same man for completely different reasons.

Alabama won 52-24. Not even close. Thirteen and oh. Perfect season. George was euphoric — tears in his eyes, calling Alabama, *Roll Tide* into the phone over and over. Persefoni was flushed in a way she hoped he didn't notice. She hugged him. She meant it. This was the best thing in the worst year of her life — these Saturdays, this couch, this shirt, this man who was her father being happy in a way that asked nothing of her.

She went to her room and she didn't look Démion up on Instagram. She didn't know why she didn't. She knew his name. She knew his number. She knew what his arms looked like when he threw and what his smile looked like when he scored. She could have found him in three seconds. She didn't look.

February. The ice storm.

An inch of ice on power lines and trees. 330,000 without power. Trees crashing under the weight of it — the eerie sound of branches snapping all night, the sharp crack and then the long tearing sound and then the thud, again and again, the neighborhood destroying itself in slow motion. Transformer explosions lighting up the darkness with a blue-white flash and then the darkness returning, deeper than before. Some without power for over a week. No electricity. No heat. February in Oregon without heat.

COVID lockdown plus no power plus no heat. The accumulated lowest point. Through all of this, Persefoni was sealed in the life raft with Alejandro. His house still had power — his neighborhood was on a different grid, or his parents had a generator, or his luck held the way his luck always held. She went to his studio and the blue light was on and the HEPA filter was humming and the air was warm and clean and the boy was there and the boy loved her and outside the trees were cracking under ice.

The hollowness calcified. Months of it. The numbness becoming structure, the guilt becoming furniture she walked around. She lived inside the hollowness now the way she lived inside the lockdown — not fighting it, not examining it, just moving through the rooms of a life that had contracted to almost nothing. Alejandro's studio. Her bedroom. The couch on Saturdays. The phone that Kathleen never answered. The fairy lights repositioned for the camera.

---

Early March. The ice storm had ended. Power was back. The lowest point had passed — or so the world thought.

She was on her phone. Scrolling Instagram. The blue light of the screen replacing the blue light of Alejandro's studio, one screen indistinguishable from another.

A DM notification.

She saw the name and her body knew before her mind did.

Démion Reyes.

The arms. The smile. The freshman QB she'd been watching on her father's couch since September — first without noticing, then noticing, then watching, then unable to stop watching. Thirteen games. Thirteen Saturdays in the elephant shirt. She'd been falling for him since October and the Championship in January made it impossible to deny and she still didn't look him up on Instagram — the restraint a tell in itself, the not-looking a form of looking, the way you avoid someone's eyes because meeting them would confirm something you're not ready to confirm.

She'd been carrying his name in her body for months. Now his name was on her screen.

The message was confident, funny, not trying hard. The ease of someone who had never had to try hard at anything. Something about her Sheepey reel — he thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen, and also he thought she was beautiful, and the way he said both things in the same sentence made it clear he meant both equally. Not a fan. Not a follower performing enthusiasm. A man who saw something he wanted and reached for it. The directness was the opposite of Alejandro — no explanations, no analysis, no careful construction of approach. Just: I saw you. I want to talk to you. Here I am.

She read it and something happened in her body that hadn't happened in months.

Want.

Not relief. Not survival. Not the numb participation she'd been offering Alejandro. Want. Physical, immediate, involuntary — the way her body responded to Alejandro's song but this time without the confusion, without the being-seen that clouded everything. This was simpler. This was the wanting she thought she'd felt and hadn't. She recognized it now because its absence had been the defining feature of the thing she was in.

She responded. The responding was the first thing she'd done in months that wasn't survival. It was choice.

They started talking — DMs at first, then texts, then late-night calls. His voice on the phone was deep and easy and he laughed the way big men laugh, from somewhere low in his chest, and the sound of it made her feel small in a way she liked, which was new. She'd been the biggest presence in every room for two years. On the phone with Démion she could be smaller. She could listen. She could laugh at his stories about Tuscaloosa — the linemen who ate like it was their job, the strength coach who spoke entirely in metaphors, the way the whole town treated him like he was already famous, which he was — and the laughing was light and the lightness was rest and the rest was something she hadn't felt since Kathleen's bed.

She went to Alejandro's less. Not a decision she announced — just the pattern shifting, the way patterns do. Four days a week became three. Three became two. She never explained why. She just wasn't there — the way she was never there when Alejandro reached for her, the same gift, the same smooth absence that didn't look like absence because she always left something in its place. A text with a question about a track he was working on. A reel she needed his opinion on. Something for his mind to hold instead of the space where she used to be. Alejandro noticed. She could see him noticing — the way he texted more on the days she didn't come, the way his questions got more specific, the way the space between his messages got shorter as the space between her visits got longer. She just went less, and then she stopped going, and the stopping was as quiet as everything else she did.

April.

Over a year after schools closed. BSD high school students began hybrid the week of April 22nd — two cohorts, each attending two full days on campus, three days online. Masks required all day. Six feet of distance. One-directional hallways. Class sizes halved. Teachers simultaneously addressing the room and a grid of laptop screens. It didn't feel like school. It felt like school cosplay. You ate lunch socially distanced. You couldn't see anyone's face below the eyes. The specific strangeness of seeing faces she'd been watching on a screen for over a year suddenly in three dimensions — everyone looked wrong, everyone looked smaller.

Persefoni went back for one reason. Not the education — she was a millionaire. Not the social life — she didn't have one. She went back for Kathleen. The return to in-person was the first time since September that she could see Kathleen with her own eyes, be in the same hallway, maybe catch her at the locker, maybe say the thing she'd been drafting and deleting on her phone for seven months. The school building was the only place Kathleen couldn't digitally seal her out. Brick and mortar. A hallway with two people in it. A chance.

She walked through the half-empty corridors, masked, looking for the face she'd known since middle school, the round face with the big eyes that she would recognize from across any distance, even with a mask, even with just the eyes showing, because Kathleen's eyes were Kathleen.

She found the locker first.

Kathleen's locker was empty. Not cleared-out-for-summer empty. Gone empty. Different lock, or no lock. Someone else's things, or nothing. Persefoni stared at it and the staring was the loneliest thing she'd done since the unanswered texts — because the locker was the plan. The locker was supposed to be the hallway she was never in. And the hallway was here and Kathleen was not.

She asked someone. Carefully, casually — her voice doing the thing her voice always did, making the desperate sound easy so nobody saw the desperation underneath. "Kathleen Unckles? Is she in the other cohort?"

"Yeah, I think so. Cohort B? She's Monday-Tuesday."

Different days. Different hallways. The school had given her the building and put Kathleen on the other side of it — two days apart, perfectly out of phase, as if the schedule itself had been designed to keep them from occupying the same space.

But you could switch. That was the rule — if two students from different cohorts both agreed, they could swap days. Persefoni found Jessica Parker in the cafeteria at lunch, a girl from her own cohort she barely knew, and asked her with the easy, bright confidence of someone who'd been making people say yes her entire life. Would she be willing to swap with Kathleen Unckles? Take Kathleen's days, give Kathleen hers? Jessica said sure. Jessica didn't care which days she came.

She texted Kathleen. Not an apology this time. Not *please* or *I'm sorry* or any of the words that had bounced off the wall for seven months. Just the logistics: *Jessica Parker is in my cohort and she'll swap with you. You'd get her days — Wednesday Thursday. You don't have to talk to me. I just want to be in the same building.*

Kathleen didn't answer her. Kathleen called Jessica Parker and told her no.

The words reached Persefoni secondhand — Jessica in the hallway the next day, apologetic, confused. "She said she didn't want to switch. Sorry. She seemed, like, really sure." Jessica's face was kind and puzzled and had no idea what she was standing in the middle of, and Persefoni smiled and said "no worries" and the smile was perfect and the "no worries" was perfect and she walked to her next class and sat down and the mask hid everything below her eyes, which was the only good thing about the mask.

Kathleen wouldn't talk to her. But Kathleen would call a girl she barely knew to make sure the switch didn't happen. The effort of the refusal — picking up the phone, dialing a stranger, saying no to something that cost nothing — was worse than the silence. The silence could be inertia. The phone call was a choice.

She drove to Kathleen's house. She knew the way — of course she knew the way. She'd been there a thousand times. The bedroom where Sheepey was born. The bed where Kathleen bounced and said *do it again.* The house that was the second-safest place in her world after her own.

She parked on the street. She sat in the car for a long time.

She went to the door. She knocked. Kathleen's mother answered. Kind. She'd always been kind. She didn't slam the door. She didn't yell. She looked at Persefoni the way you look at someone you used to love having in your house and now can't let in, and the looking was worse than anger because it had sadness in it instead of heat.

"Kathleen can't come to the door."

Five words. The kindest, most final sentence in the chapter of her life that was Beaverton. A wall made of gentleness, which was the hardest kind to push against because you couldn't be angry at people who were being gentle while they shut you out.

Persefoni stood on the porch of the house where everything started and the door was a wall and the wall was soft and the softness was final.

"Is she okay?" Persefoni asked.

"She's okay."

They didn't say more. She could feel the conversation ending — the polite, kind ending of a conversation that was over before it started.

"Can you tell her I came by?"

They said they would. She knew it wouldn't matter.

She walked back to the car. She sat in the car and the sitting was the last thing she did in Beaverton that mattered. The door was shut. Not by Kathleen — by the people who loved Kathleen, who were protecting Kathleen from the girl who broke her. Persefoni couldn't even be angry at them. She'd do the same thing.

She saw no way to get her friend back. The locker was empty. The house was a wall. The phone was a wall. Every door that used to lead to Kathleen was sealed, and the sealing was gentle, and the gentleness was permanent.

She tried for two months. Every avenue sealed. School was useless — masked, half-empty, the cosplay of an education she didn't need. She went through the motions of being a student the way she went through the motions of being a girlfriend. Performance without commitment. Presence without arrival.

Démion got drafted by Tampa Bay on April 29th — first overall, like everyone knew he would. He was in Tampa now, the city throwing itself at his feet, the whole state of Florida buzzing with the arrival of the greatest player anyone had ever seen. He talked about it on their late-night calls — "the free state of Florida," he called it, half-joking, half-serious. No mask mandates. Restaurants open. Beaches open. Life at full volume. The opposite of Beaverton. The opposite of sealed rooms and filtered air and smoke and ice and the slow suffocation of a life that had contracted to nothing.

She lay in her bedroom at night with the fairy lights on — the same lights, the same room, but the lights were positioned for the camera now, not for warmth, the warmth become set design — and she talked to him on the phone and his voice was enormous. Not just the bass of it — the confidence, the ease, the way he talked about his life as if it were a thing that bent to accommodate him. He talked the way she used to talk — before the hollowness, before the guilt, before the pressed flower went flat. He talked the way someone talks when they've never had to earn the air they breathe.

---

She was in her bedroom. Fairy lights on, positioned for the camera. She'd just filmed a Sheepey reel — a good one, maybe the best one yet. The stories fully alive, the comedy landing, the absurd history of a stuffed sheep masking the heartbreak underneath the way it always did.

She watched the playback. It was perfect.

She picked up her phone. Opened Kathleen's contact. The name still there — the name that used to light up the screen twelve times a day, the name with the exclamation marks, the name that was the most consistent thing in her life. Her thumb hovered. She typed:

*I did Sheepey on Instagram today. I think you would have—*

She stopped. Deleted it. The sentence she couldn't finish. *I think you would have laughed. I think you would have said "do it again." I think you would have known this isn't the same and loved me anyway.*

She posted the reel. The exclamation marks came in waves. None of them were Kathleen's.

---

Late May. Démion said come visit. The ease of it — the way he said it, like the distance between Oregon and Florida was nothing, like geography was a suggestion, like the world bent for people like them.

She booked a flight. She told Alejandro she was going to visit a friend. She told herself the same thing.

She went to Tampa.

She did not come back.

Not dramatically. Not with a goodbye. Not with a scene or a confrontation or a text that said *it's over.* She just didn't come back. She bought a place — a three-million-dollar condo in St. Petersburg, cash, eighteen years old, the way only a millionaire teenager with no one to answer to can buy a place. The return flight sat unused. Her bedroom in Beaverton stayed the way she left it — fairy lights positioned for the camera, the set of a life she'd walked out of. She didn't walk at graduation. She didn't bother to graduate.

She was eighteen and a millionaire and famous and the only person she wanted to see in Beaverton wouldn't see her, so there was nothing in Beaverton. And Démion was in Tampa. And St. Pete was warm and loud and open and the opposite of everything that had been suffocating her for nine months.

She left the way Kathleen left — without announcement, without a scene. She knew it, too. She could feel the shape of it — Kathleen stopping answering, Persefoni stopping coming back. Two girls who loved each other, each disappearing through a door that closed without slamming.

The quietest departures are the most permanent.

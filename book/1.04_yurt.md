# Chapter 1.4 — The Yurt

*"By paying a certain kind of attention, you can humanise or dehumanise, cherish or strip of all value. By a kind of alienating, fragmenting and focal attention, you can reduce humanity — or art, sex, humour, or religion — to nothing."*
— Iain McGilchrist, *The Master and His Emissary*

The posters were everywhere.

That was the thing about Hay-on-Wye — you couldn't walk ten feet without encountering a bookshop, and you couldn't pass a bookshop without encountering a poster, and every poster in every bookshop window was advertising the same children's book by a local author: *Muffin and the Passage of Time.* Alejandro had counted seven posters in the last twenty minutes, which was the sort of thing he did — he counted — while Persephone marched ahead of them through the narrow streets as if the evening light and the cobblestones and the bunting strung between the buildings were all an obstacle course between her and her objective.

She wanted a copy. She'd been talking about the title for an hour.

"A muffin, Kathleen," she was saying, walking backward so she could face them, nearly colliding with a man carrying a box of secondhand paperbacks. "A muffin. And the passage of time. On a children's book. Someone did that."

"Maybe it's about a muffin who—"

"Don't. I don't want to know. He's in a library. He's been in a library for years. He's seen too much. He sits there and he contemplates the void and nobody eats him because you can't eat a muffin who's contemplated the void. It would be disrespectful."

Kathleen was laughing so hard she'd stopped walking. Alejandro had been thinking about the title himself — the juxtaposition of something as absurd as a muffin with something as heavy as the passage of time, the baked good and the infinite, and what it meant that someone had put them next to each other on a children's book — but he'd been thinking about it the way he thought about everything, structurally, taking it apart, and by the time he'd gotten anywhere with it she'd already built the muffin a biography and a library and an existential crisis. He watched her face — the way it opened when she was building something, the eyes wide and bright, the hands sculpting air — and he thought: *spontaneous mythopoesis.* Again. She encountered a title and within three minutes it was alive.

But beneath that thought, under it and older than it, another one was still turning: *Why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it.* She'd said it on the stone wall. She'd said it like it was nothing — offhand, easy, the way she said everything that mattered — and it had landed in him the way the Cohen line had landed, not as understanding but as recognition. The thing he'd been laboring toward for months, the thing he'd spent hundreds of notebook pages trying to translate from McGilchrist's academic precision into something that lived and breathed, she'd produced in a single sentence without even trying. She'd skipped the explanation and arrived at the feeling and she hadn't even noticed she'd done it.

*Imposible.* The word surfaced in his first language because his second didn't have the right inflection for it — the Spanish *imposible* carried wonder where the English carried negation.

He admired this. It also made him want to lie down in the street.

The first bookshop was sold out. "Oh, *Muffin!*" the woman behind the counter said, with the fond exasperation of someone who'd been fielding this question all day. "Sold out this morning, love. Try Booth's."

Booth's was sold out. The third shop — a narrow one squeezed between a café and a second café — had sold their last copy an hour ago and seemed genuinely sorry about it. The man behind the counter started giving them directions to another shop and Persephone was already out the door.

Alejandro followed. He always followed. Kathleen was holding his hand and he was following Persephone through a town full of bookshops in the golden hour of a summer evening, and if he'd been asked to classify the feeling — and he was always being asked to classify the feeling, the question was always there, the Emissary with its clipboard — he would have said: a complex admixture of aesthetic pleasure and anticipatory affect, elevated cortisol consistent with proximity to a desired stimulus, and an undertone of something he didn't have a word for — or had a word for, but only in Spanish, and the word was *anhelo*, which meant longing but also meant the ache of reaching for a thing you could see but couldn't hold — that lived in his chest like a low frequency he could feel but not hear.

That wasn't right. None of his words were right. Not for this.

The last shop was near the edge of town, down a side street that smelled like rain and old stone. It was the kind of bookshop that had a cat asleep on the history section and a woman behind the counter who looked like she'd been there since the building was built. Persephone asked about Muffin. The woman's face did something careful.

"I've got one copy left," she said. "I was saving it for my niece."

Persephone's face. Alejandro watched it happen — the delight, the hope, the way she held her hands together in front of her chest like a child at Christmas — and the old woman watched it too, and something passed between them that he could observe but not participate in, a transaction conducted in a currency he didn't carry. *Un regalo.* The woman reached under the counter and produced the book and handed it across, and she wasn't reluctant about it. She was glad. Because Persephone's joy was the kind that made people want to give her things.

He picked it up before Persephone could stop him. Turned it over. Read the back.

"It's a mule," he said.

"What?"

"Muffin. It's a mule. Not a — the Passage is an underground tunnel. It's a children's book about a mule named Muffin who finds a tunnel that travels through time."

He watched her process this — the existential pastry, the baked good confronting infinity, all of it wrong, spectacularly wrong — and he waited for the disappointment, because that was what his brain predicted: the construction meeting reality, the projection dissolving.

She loved it more.

"A *mule?*" She was holding the book to her chest. "That's better. That's so much better. Kathleen — he goes to the Renaissance. He definitely goes to the Renaissance and doesn't care for it."

"He meets a Victorian horse," Kathleen said, already there, already inside the game.

"The Victorian horse is insufferable about it. Obviously. Horses in the Victorian era were terrible snobs — everyone knows this."

She read bits aloud as they walked back to the yurts. She did voices. Muffin was stoic and long-suffering, with a Welsh accent — "On account of the tunnel being in Wales, Kathleen, keep up" — and the narrator was a slightly confused uncle who'd never met a mule and was doing his best. She was building Muffin's biography the way she'd built Sheepey's, out of nothing, out of air, out of whatever it was that lived in her that didn't live in him. He could have looked it up on his phone — Muffin was probably something, a reference, a character, the kind of thing that would have a Wikipedia page. His phone was in his pocket. He was watching her face. He was always watching her face. And the drawer was open and he wasn't even trying to close it, because the evening was warm and Kathleen was holding his hand and Persephone was making a mule named Muffin real just by talking about him, and for a little while the classification system went quiet — *por fin*, finally, the machinery winding down — and the three of them walked back through the festival in the last of the light. The castle was there as they passed — he'd barely noticed it during the day, but now in the dusk it was just a shape, old stone and ivy above the roofline, holding whatever it held — and then they were past it, and it was good, and it was complicated, and nobody was saying the complicated part.

The yurt at night was a different animal.

The wood stove was going — George had come by earlier to light it, because George handled everything — and the cast iron ticked quietly in the dark, sending up a glow that turned the nearest canvas wall orange and red and flickering, like the inside of a lantern. At the top of the yurt, the wooden crown had a round opening where the support poles met — a smoke hole, covered by a small cone of canvas set a foot above it, so that rain couldn't fall in but air could escape through the ring of open space between the cone and the crown. During the day you could see sky through that ring. Now it showed only dark — a thin band of stars visible around the edges, the moon somewhere else, not yet overhead. What moonlight there was came through the canvas walls — not directly but diffused, the way light comes through skin, turning the fabric a faint silver-blue. The stove was winning. The yurt was mostly warm, mostly orange, with just that cool glow at the edges where the canvas thinned.

Persephone and Kathleen were in the left bed. Alejandro was in the right. The low wooden table sat between them with the lantern unlit, and Muffin the book was propped against it next to Sheepey the sheep, and the last sounds of the evening were Persephone's voice doing Sheepey's reaction to Muffin — "He finds the mule rather common, but respects his commitment to the tunnel" — and Kathleen's laugh, quieter now, sleepy, winding down.

Silence settled the way it does in canvas rooms: slowly, then all at once. The stove ticked. Wind moved through the walls — not howling, not even blowing, just moving, the way wind moves through grass, bending the canvas gently and letting go. Somewhere across the field a guitar was playing, so faint it might have been memory.

Alejandro lay on his back and stared up at the crown — the ring of wood where the poles met, the cone of the rain cover above it, and through the gap between them a thin band of night sky. Stars in the ring. No moon yet. He was thinking about the king in the tower. The servant running the kingdom. He was still working on the metaphor — still turning it, still trying to find the angle where the light hit it and it became a feeling instead of an idea. Persephone had gotten there in one sentence. *Why someone can feel something and be told they're not feeling it.* That was the Emissary. That was the whole book. The servant tells you your experience isn't real, and because the servant is the one with the language, the labels, the classification system, you believe him.

He was aware of the two shapes in the other bed. Persephone's curls dark against the pillow, catching the stove-light and turning briefly copper when the flames shifted. Kathleen's smaller form curled against her, the down comforter pulled up to her chin. Two girls breathing. The yurt breathing around them. The wind through the canvas and the distant guitar and the stove ticking and ticking.

He didn't sleep.

---

Kathleen's feet on the fur rug.

That was the first thing — the sound of them, soft and deliberate, crossing the gap between the beds. Not fumbling. Not hesitant. She sounded like someone who knew what she was doing. He suspected the deciding had happened hours ago, maybe days ago — her hand in the car had been the overture, the body speaking a language his brain was still trying to translate, and now she was here, at the edge of his bed, and the translation was no longer necessary.

She slipped in beside him. Small. Warm. *Ahora.* Now. Her hand found his chest and rested there, and his heart was doing something he could have described precisely — tachycardia, sympathetic nervous system activation, a cascade of neurochemical events involving norepinephrine and dopamine — and all of those words meant nothing, meant less than nothing, because his body was answering hers the way it had answered in the car, immediately, involuntarily, a sudden urgent syllable in a language he hadn't known he was fluent in.

She kissed him. Or he kissed her. The distinction collapsed somewhere between intention and contact and it didn't matter because his brain was already losing. He could feel it happening — the taxonomic machinery spinning, reaching for terms, finding them dissolving on contact with her mouth, with her hands, with the warmth of her pressed against him. He thought *arousal* and the word evaporated. He thought *neurochemistry* and it was gone. She was pulling at his shirt and his hands found her hips — the curve of her waist, the shape he'd always focused on when he was trying to find the physical pull — and it was there, it was real, her body was something he could want if he concentrated, and he was concentrating, and his hands held the warmth of her and his body rose to meet her and it was a choice, it was a thing he was choosing, and it was nothing — nothing — compared to the involuntary.

He closed his eyes.

He had to. Something had changed in the yurt — the light had shifted while they weren't watching, the moon tracking across the sky until it found the ring at the top of the crown. What had been a faint glow through canvas was now direct moonlight — angled through the gap between the cone and the crown, silver-blue and sharp, falling across the beds and pooling on the fur rug. The yurt was brighter than it had any right to be. More than enough to see by. And if he opened his eyes he'd see Kathleen's face. Round. Sweet. Those wide brown eyes looking at him. And he couldn't. Not because she wasn't — she was — but because behind his eyelids something else was already there. Chocolate curls. Pale green eyes. Golden brown skin. The girl in the other bed.

Kathleen was on top of him. She'd done this — arranged this — with the same quiet certainty she'd had crossing the floor, and he was on his back, passive, receiving, his hands on her hips and his eyes closed, and she was the one moving, the one deciding, the one who wanted this with her whole self. He let it happen. He let her happen to him. The distinction between letting and wanting was the entire distance between who Kathleen thought he was and who he actually was, and it was six feet wide, the width of the gap between the beds.

His brain wouldn't stop. His brain never stopped. Even now — especially now — it was running, narrating, cataloging. *This is your first time. You are fifteen years old and this is your first time and you are imagining someone else. Her breathing is different from the breathing you're imagining. Her body is smaller than the body you're imagining.* He shoved the observation into the drawer. The drawer was broken. He shoved anyway and it fell out and he shoved it again and it fell out again and the drawer was open and everything was on the floor.

The body won. For long stretches the body simply won — sensation overriding everything, his breath and her breath and the heat between them, the language he didn't know he spoke filling his mouth, filling his chest, filling the space where the words usually were — and he was just a body, just here, just this. And then the brain would surface, gasping, offering another observation he didn't want: *you are the servant. You are running the kingdom.*

He kept his eyes closed.

But his eyes opened — still inside it, still moving — and he saw. The moonlight was pouring through the ring now, angled across the yurt, and the geometry of the space put them at the edge of it. Kathleen's face was in the full moon — silver-blue, her skin pale and cool in that direct light, her eyes closed, her lips parted. And his own body was in the glow of the stove — orange, warm, flickering. The two lights divided the space cleanly, one on each side, meeting nowhere. He noticed this. He cataloged it because he cataloged everything: she was blue and he was orange and the two lights fell on them like a line drawn down the middle of something.

He closed his eyes again.

Behind his eyelids: Persephone. Always Persephone. And the question he couldn't answer and couldn't stop asking — was she awake? Across the gap, in the other bed, six feet away, was she hearing this? Part of him wanted her awake. Wanted her listening. *Vergüenza.* The wanting disgusted him even as it moved through him, and the disgust didn't diminish the wanting, not even slightly — the idea that she might be there, present, aware, hearing him, made the whole thing more vivid in a way he could classify precisely and wished he couldn't. As if nothing fully existed for him unless she was witnessing it.

And part of him wanted her asleep. Desperately. Because if she was awake, she knew. She always knew. She'd known in the car and she'd known at the stone wall and she knew, with the particular clarity of someone who saw things before they were named, that something in this yurt was wrong. And he couldn't bear the thought of those pale green eyes open in the dark, knowing what he was.

He held both — wanting her awake, wanting her asleep — the way he held everything about Persephone: in contradiction, without resolution, passive. Another thing he let happen to him instead of choosing.

Kathleen's breathing changed — deeper, slower, her head tipping back, her weight shifting above him. He opened his eyes again. He looked at the other bed.

Persephone was facing away from them. Her back, her shape under the comforter, the curls on the pillow — and the stove was behind her, on her side of the yurt, and the light of it streamed through her curls and lit them orange, copper, almost red, so that they looked like they were on fire. As he watched, she shifted — a small movement, her shoulder adjusting, her body resettling. He listened for her breathing. He couldn't hear it. The yurt was quiet — just canvas and wind and the stove ticking — and if she were asleep he'd hear it. The absence meant she was holding her breath or she was too still to hear or she was awake and trying not to move. He didn't know. He would never know.

Kathleen whispered his name.

His name. Not anyone else's. She was here — he could hear it in the way she said it, could feel it in the way she held him — completely here, having what he suspected was the most important night of her life with the boy she loved, and she said his name like it was the only word left, and it went through him like a knife, not because it hurt — it did — but because the name she was saying belonged to someone who wasn't in the room. *No soy él.* The Alejandro she was whispering to — the one who loved her, who was here with her, who had chosen this — that Alejandro didn't exist.

He closed his eyes before she opened hers.

---

Kathleen against his chest. Her breathing slowing. Her hand on his collarbone, her fingers tracing small absent circles, her body curled into him with what felt like the boneless trust of someone who has never once doubted that she is loved. She pressed her face into his neck and whispered something he could barely hear — it might have been his name again, or it might have been nothing, just breath shaped into almost-sound. He could feel it in the way she held him, the way she gathered herself against him — she was happy, or seemed happy, or was doing the thing that happiness looks like from the outside. This was, he was almost certain, the best night of her life.

Alejandro opened his eyes.

Moonlight. Still angled through the ring at the top of the crown, silver and steady on the fur rug between the beds. The yurt was exactly what it was before — fur rugs, wood stove, two beds. Everything unchanged except the light. The stove still ticking, the wind still moving through the walls, bending the canvas gently and letting go. The same distant guitar, or a different one. Hard to tell.

In the other bed, Persephone's shape under the comforter. Still. Her back to them, or maybe not — maybe her face to the wall, maybe her eyes open, maybe her eyes closed. No way to know.

He stared up at the crown. Through the ring between the cone and the wooden circle, he could see the moon — not the whole of it, just an arc, bright and close, its light angling down through the gap into the yurt. All those support poles climbing up from the walls and meeting at a ring of wood around a ring of sky around a sliver of moon. He thought about the king in the tower. He thought about the servant. He thought about how the servant didn't storm the castle — that wasn't how the story went. The servant just kept talking. Kept narrating. Kept telling everyone, including the king, that the servant's version of things was the correct one, until eventually the king went quiet. Not because he agreed. Because he couldn't be heard over the noise.

He had new data for his classification system. He knew what it felt like to betray someone while they were holding you. He knew the specific weight of it — not guilt, exactly, not yet, something more structural, a hairline fracture running through a thing he'd thought was solid. He reached for a metaphor. The drawer. The tower. The servant and the king. None of them worked. The classification system had encountered something it couldn't file, and for the first time in his life the system had nothing to say.

*Hay cosas que no se pueden traducir.* Some things resist translation.

Kathleen was asleep. Her breathing was even and warm against his neck. Outside the yurt, the festival had gone quiet — just wind and canvas and the stove settling and somewhere far off, that guitar, playing something he almost recognized but couldn't name. The two lights were still there — the orange glow of the stove fading as the embers burned down, the moonlight steady and silver through the opening above him — and both were enough to see by, and he lay there with his eyes open and saw nothing.

The brain had nothing left to say. Not even in Spanish. Not even in the language that came before the language that came before the words. *Nada.*

  <h2>E.L. Muffin</h2>
  <p class="author-bio">E.L. Muffin earned his PhD at the University of Washington in 2010 and has been building machine learning systems ever since — first at Preact, which Spotify acquired in 2016, then seven years inside the machine itself. He left to start MuffinLabs, where he helps teams build systems that scale. This is his first novel. He wrote it because he had to.</p>

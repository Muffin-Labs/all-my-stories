The air hit her like a wall.

Not a metaphor — an actual wall of heat, dense and wet, that met her the moment the jet bridge ended and the terminal began. Tampa International in late May, the afternoon sun cooking the tarmac outside the windows, the air conditioning fighting and losing and the humidity winning anyway, finding its way through every seal and vent and sliding door to remind you where you were. Florida. She was in Florida. She'd been in Florida for ninety seconds and her skin was already different — not sweating yet, not quite, but *awake* in a way it hadn't been in Beaverton, where the air was cool and damp and polite and never asked you to notice it.

This air asked.

She walked through the terminal with her carry-on and her phone and the feeling in her body was not what she expected. She'd expected something — she didn't know what. Nervousness. The flutter of a girl going to meet a boy she'd been talking to for three months through screens. The awareness of what she'd done — left. Just left. Not told Alejandro. Not packed properly. Not graduated. Not said goodbye to the house or the bedroom or the fairy lights that were still arranged for the camera in a room nobody was filming in.

She felt none of that. She felt the heat. She felt the terminal around her — bright, modern, louder than PDX, the aggressive friendliness of Florida signage, the palm trees visible through every window, real palm trees, not the kind Portland imported and apologized for. She felt her carry-on wheels clicking on the tile. She felt her phone in her back pocket, silent for once — not buzzing, not demanding, just a warm rectangle against her hip.

She felt here.

Not "I'm finally here" — that was a narration, a story you told yourself about arriving, and she wasn't telling herself anything. She was just walking through an airport in Florida and the air was thick and her skin was awake and she was eighteen years old and she had nowhere to be except exactly where she was going.

He was leaning against a black SUV in the pickup lane.

She saw him before he saw her — or she thought she did, though later she'd wonder if he'd seen her first and just not moved, because Démion didn't move toward things. Things moved toward him. He was leaning against the driver's side door with his arms crossed and his sunglasses pushed up on his forehead and he was — God. He was real. He was real in a way that the screen had not prepared her for, the way thirteen Saturdays on her father's couch had not prepared her for, because television compressed him and the world did not. 6'6". Two hundred and fifty pounds. The arms she'd watched throw the go-ahead touchdown in the SEC Championship were right there, crossed against a chest that was wider than the car door behind it. He was wearing a white T-shirt and grey shorts and he looked like something a sculptor had made and forgotten to make smaller.

He saw her. The smile. The one the camera always found after a touchdown — *I knew this would happen* — except now it was aimed at her and she was not on a couch and her father was not in the next cushion and the smile hit her in the sternum like a ball she hadn't seen coming.

"There she is," he said.

His voice was lower in person. Warmer. The phone had flattened it the way the phone flattened everything — made it smaller, tinnier, a version of the thing and not the thing itself. This was the thing itself. Deep and easy and unhurried, the voice of someone who had never rushed in his life because the world had never given him a reason to.

She walked to the SUV and he unfolded his arms and the unfolding was like watching architecture rearrange — the chest opening, the arms widening, the sheer amount of him suddenly available, and she walked into it. Into him. His arms closed around her and she was inside them and the first thing she thought was: *oh.* Not a word. A sound. The sound of arriving somewhere your body already knew about.

He smelled like soap and heat and something underneath both of those things that was just him — skin, warmth, the particular scent of a body that spent four hours a day in a gym and the rest of the day being twenty years old and alive. She pressed her face against his chest and breathed in and the breathing was simple and full and the opposite of every breath she'd taken in Beaverton for the last nine months.

No smoke. No HEPA filter. No blue light.

Just air. Just him. Just here.

---

He took her to dinner at a place on the water.

She didn't remember the name of the restaurant later — only the details that her body kept. The deck over the bay, the water catching the last of the sunset, the sky going pink and orange and then the deep purple that Florida did better than anywhere she'd ever been. The breeze off the Gulf, warm and salt-heavy, moving through her hair like fingers. The way he sat across from her and took up the entire side of the booth and didn't apologize for it and didn't need to. The way he ate — the same way he did everything, without self-consciousness, with the focused attention of someone who was very good at being alive.

They'd been talking for three months. DMs since March, texts since April, phone calls since — she couldn't remember exactly when the calls started. Sometime after the ice storm. Sometime after the world had been dark and frozen and the power was out and the trees were crashing and then his name appeared on her screen like a window opening in a sealed room. They'd talked about everything. They'd talked about nothing. The calls had the quality of two people who were already past the part where you figure out if you like each other and were deep into the part where you just want to hear each other's voice at 1 AM for no reason.

But the screen had lied. Not lied — compressed. Flattened. Made manageable. Démion on a phone screen was a handsome face and a warm voice. Démion across a table was an event. The way he moved his hands when he talked — not the way Alejandro moved his hands, the desperate fluttering of a mind trying to shape something too big for words, but the slow, deliberate gestures of a man whose hands were built for gripping and throwing and holding and who used them sparingly, the way someone uses a tool they know is powerful. The way he leaned forward when she said something that interested him, which was a structural event — two hundred and fifty pounds shifting toward her, the table creaking slightly, the booth absorbing the weight. The way he laughed, which was loud and free and unperformed, the laugh of someone who had never once worried about how his laugh sounded.

She talked. She was Persephoni and she talked the way she always talked — fast, vivid, the observations arriving without preamble and landing without explanation, and he leaned into every one of them. Not the way Alejandro leaned in — Alejandro leaned in to classify, to file, to find the framework. Démion leaned in to get closer. The difference was physical. You could feel it in the air between them. One man leaned in to understand you. This man leaned in to be near you.

"I want you," he said.

Not at the end of the night. Not after some careful arc of escalation, some architectural approach, some hand on her lower back building toward a question he was too afraid to ask. He said it at dinner. Over food. Mid-conversation. She was telling him about Sheepey — the drunk dignified sheep, the Stonehenge backstory, the gambling problem — and he was laughing and then he stopped laughing and looked at her with an expression she'd never seen on a man's face before, or had never noticed, which was the same thing.

"I want you," he said. "I just want you to know that."

And then he picked up his fork and kept eating, like he'd told her the weather.

The directness landed in her body like a bell being struck. Not the words — the manner. The plain way he said it. The absence of strategy. Alejandro had wanted her for years and never once said it out loud — had let it build in his frameworks and his music and his careful physical angles, the hand on her lower back, the leaning in, the reaching that she'd redirected a hundred times because he never said the word and she never had to answer it. Démion said it at dinner on the first date with his mouth full, like the most natural sentence in the world. *I want you. I just want you to know that.*

"Not yet," she said.

He nodded. "Okay."

And he meant it. She could see that he meant it — not the way Alejandro would have meant it, which was *I'll wait because I'm afraid the answer is no,* but the way a man means it when the answer is never in question and the only variable is time. He said okay the way you say okay to someone who tells you dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. Patient, because there was no other way to be when the outcome was already known.

They went back to his place. A house — not a mansion, but the kind of house a first overall draft pick buys when he's twenty years old and the signing bonus clears and the realtor shows him waterfront property on Davis Islands with a pool and a dock and he says "yeah, this one." It was big and clean and new and it smelled like him, the way his arms smelled like him, the way everything in his orbit smelled like him — soap and warmth and the underneath thing.

They made out on his couch. His hands on her waist, her hands on his shoulders — the width of them, the impossible width, her fingers not even close to spanning the distance from one edge to the other. His mouth was warm and certain and unhurried. He kissed the way he played — instinctual, improvisational, reading her body's signals the way he read a defense, adjusting in real time, and the quality of attention was total. She was the only thing in the room. She was the whole field.

He pulled back. "Stay."

She stayed. In his bed, in his arms, the ceiling fan turning slowly above them, the Florida night outside the windows warm and dark and full of sounds she didn't recognize — insects, water, the particular hum of a place that never fully cooled. He didn't push. He held her and his holding was easy — not careful, not cautious, not the held-breath tenderness of a boy who couldn't believe she was in his bed. The ease of someone who expected good things to happen because good things had always happened.

She fell asleep in his arms and the falling was simple and the simplicity was the whole point.

---

She never went back.

Not dramatically. Not the way it would look in a movie — the heroine deciding, the music swelling, the moment of choice. She just didn't go back. She had a return flight for Sunday. On Sunday she was lying by his pool in the morning sun and the idea of Portland — the grey, the rain, the house with the fairy lights still positioned for the camera — felt like a memory from a life she'd already left. She changed the flight. Then she changed it again. Then she stopped changing it and let it expire and that was that.

She called her parents. Her dad said "That's my girl" in the voice he used when Persephoni did something that confirmed his narrative of her as extraordinary, and she could hear him already building the story — *my baby girl moved to Florida, eighteen years old, you know she's got that Minton in her* — and she let him build it because her dad building stories was just her dad breathing and you didn't ask someone to stop breathing.

Her mom said "Are you safe?" in the voice she used when something was happening that she couldn't quite see but could feel the shape of. Persephoni said yes. Her mom said okay. The okay had something underneath it — the same thing that was always underneath her mom's okays, the instinct without a vocabulary, the seeing-without-naming that Persephoni had learned to hear and not respond to because responding would mean naming the thing and the thing had no name.

She didn't call Alejandro.

---

The condo was on the twenty-third floor of a tower in downtown St. Petersburg, across the bay from Tampa, thirty minutes from Démion's house on Davis Islands.

Three million dollars. Cash. She was eighteen.

Kelli Garcia at Smith and Associates came highly recommended, and Persephoni could see why — a woman in her thirties with the specific Florida energy of someone who had sold waterfront property to athletes and influencers and people with more money than sense and had learned to stop being surprised. She walked Persephoni through the unit and said the things realtors say: the view, the finishes, the square footage, the HOA. Persephoni looked at the view. The bay spread out below her, blue and flat and infinite, Tampa's skyline across the water, the Sunshine Skyway in the distance like a harp laid on its side. She could see Démion's neighborhood from here. Not his house — just the general direction, the island, the idea of him. Close enough to choose. Far enough to have a self.

She bought it that day.

She'd never had a space that was only hers. Not the bedroom in Beaverton, which was her parents' house and her parents' mortgage and her parents' air. Not Alejandro's studio, which was his blue light and his loop station and his frameworks and his wanting. Not the bedroom she'd turned into a set, fairy lights repositioned for the camera, the room a stage where the girl performing was a pressed flower of the girl living. This was hers. These walls, this view, this air — Florida air, coming through the vents, conditioned but not filtered, not purified, not made necessary by a machine — this was the first room in her life that belonged to Persephoni and nobody else.

She stood in the empty living room and the windows went floor to ceiling and the bay was below and the sky was everywhere and she didn't think anything. She didn't narrate the moment to herself. She didn't think *I'm finally free* or *this is where my life begins* or any of the things she might have put in a caption. She just stood there and the room was empty and the emptiness was not a hollowness but a space — a space she would fill with whatever she chose, whenever she chose, without asking permission from anyone.

The air moved through the vents and it was just air.

---

Lauria Wilson — La — was a phone call and a handshake and a contract signed three days after the condo closed.

Persephoni was nothing if not shrewd. She knew what she'd left behind in Beaverton — not just Alejandro, not just the blue-lit studio, not just the boy who wanted her. She'd left the brain. The content strategy, the analytics, the architecture of her brand — Alejandro had built all of it. The Instagram pivot, the voice-over-dance structure, the engagement metrics he'd mapped and optimized until her following wasn't just growing but growing *correctly,* in the ways that translated to money. He'd done this for her because he loved her, or because he thought the doing was love, and the love and the strategy had been so tangled together that leaving one meant leaving both.

She needed the strategy without the love.

La was the strategy without the love. Mid-thirties, sharp, based in Miami, the kind of manager who had three phones and answered all of them and never confused professional devotion with the other kind. She'd been watching Persephoni's numbers for months — she told her this at their first meeting, at a restaurant in St. Pete where La ordered a sparkling water and a salad and talked about brand partnerships the way Alejandro talked about hemispheres: with the focused passion of someone who believed the thing they were explaining was the most important thing in the world. Except La's passion was clean. It came with a fee structure and a contract and terms that both parties had read.

"You're undermonetized," La said, the way a doctor says *you're dehydrated* — clinical, fixable, not a moral failing. "The following is there. The engagement is there. You're leaving money on the table."

Persephoni let her pick it up.

No more transactions disguised as relationships. No more boy in a studio whose strategy was a love language she'd never agreed to speak. The deal was explicit now: La built the empire, Persephoni was the empire, and the line between building and being was drawn in ink, not in the ambiguity of a not-relationship that one person could see and the other couldn't.

She signed the contract and felt something she couldn't name — not relief exactly, not victory. Something closer to the feeling of a bone being set. A thing that had been misaligned, clicking into place.

One of the first things La did was define the intellectual property. Sheepey — the character, the voice, the brand, the merchandise potential, everything the drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge had become and was becoming — needed to be formalized. Ownership. Licensing. The legal architecture that turned a stuffed animal into an asset.

Persephoni said: "Half goes to Kathleen Unckles."

La looked at her. Persephoni could see the question forming — *who is Kathleen Unckles* — and answered it before it arrived. "She's my best friend. She was there when Sheepey was born. He's hers too."

La didn't argue. La was a professional, and professionals didn't argue with the client about who owned what — they documented the client's wishes and made the paperwork clean. She drew up the offer. Fifty percent of the Sheepey IP, all rights and revenues, to Kathleen Unckles of Beaverton, Oregon. A letter was sent. An email was sent. A follow-up was sent.

Kathleen never responded.

Not a no. Not a negotiation. Not a *thank you but I can't.* Nothing. The same silence that had met every text, every call, every draft composed and deleted on a phone held in the loneliest hands in Beaverton. The offer sat in whatever inbox or mailbox it had landed in, and the sitting was the answer, and the answer was the same answer it had always been: the door was shut. Even money couldn't open it. Even the acknowledgment that Sheepey was theirs — not hers, *theirs* — couldn't open it. The half that belonged to Kathleen stayed unclaimed, and the unclaiming was its own kind of silence, and the silence said what Kathleen had been saying since September: *I don't want anything from you. Not even the thing that's mine.*

La filed the paperwork with the half-ownership held in trust, in case Kathleen ever changed her mind. Persephoni didn't ask about it again.

June in Florida was a dare.

The heat wasn't weather — it was a presence, a thing that lived in the air and pressed against your skin and followed you indoors and waited for you outside every door. She'd never experienced anything like it. Beaverton's summers were warm in the way that a polite person is warm — pleasant, measured, apologetic about being too much. Florida's summer was not apologetic. Florida's summer grabbed you by the face and said *this is where you live now* and Persephoni, who had spent nine months in sealed rooms and filtered air and the grey suffocation of a Pacific Northwest lockdown, walked into the heat like walking into an embrace.

She was outside all the time. This was the thing — the simple, physical, unremarkable thing that was actually the most remarkable thing. She was *outside.* After the smoke lockdown and the COVID lockdown and the ice storm and the months of Alejandro's studio with the HEPA filter humming and the blue light turning everything the same color — after all of that, she was outside. Walking. Driving with the windows down. Sitting on her balcony twenty-three floors up with the bay wind in her hair and the sun on her arms and nothing between her body and the sky.

She didn't think about this. She didn't examine the freedom or name it or narrate it to herself. She was just in it. The way a fish is in water, the way a bird is in air — not noticing the medium because the medium was everywhere and there was nothing to compare it to, or rather, the comparison was behind her and she wasn't looking back.

She filmed Sheepey reels on the balcony with the bay behind her. The character was alive — had been alive since she'd put him on camera in the last weeks of Beaverton, the public Sheepey, the one the internet loved. He kept growing. The drunk dignified sheep from Stonehenge, telling stories about his past adventures, maintaining his composure despite everything — the audience couldn't get enough. La was already fielding calls. Production companies. Streaming platforms. Someone from Netflix had emailed, and La had emailed back, and Persephoni hadn't looked at the email yet because looking at it would mean thinking about what Sheepey was becoming and she wasn't ready to think about that.

She knew what Sheepey was becoming. She'd known since the merch conversation in Beaverton — since someone suggested a plush, a copy, the seven-dollar original becoming inventory again. Sheepey was becoming a property. The most private thing she'd ever created, the character born in a car with Kathleen, was becoming the most public thing she owned. And the space between private and public was the space where Kathleen used to be, and thinking about that space was the one thing she couldn't do right now, so she didn't. She filmed the reels and the character was funny and the numbers climbed and the Netflix email sat unopened in La's inbox and the bay sparkled below and the sun was on her face and she was here. She was here.

She saw Démion almost every day.

The bay between them was thirty minutes of bridge and highway, and she drove it or he drove it and the driving became routine in the way that breathing became routine — something you did without thinking about, without planning, the way two bodies in the same orbit kept finding each other not because of a decision but because of a gravity that predated the decision.

They went to his place. They went to hers. They ate at restaurants on the water — Tampa's waterfront, St. Pete's downtown, the whole bay area spread out like a table set for people who had money and time and the particular freedom of two famous people in a city that was just learning their names. Tampa knew Démion — the number one pick, the savior, the kid drafted to carry the franchise after Brady retired on top, the city already putting his face on things. St. Pete was learning Persephoni — the influencer, the girlfriend, the girl in the tower with the views and the following. Together they were becoming something the city was building a story about, the way cities do, the way people do — two beautiful people, both extraordinary, both young, both radiating the specific magnetism of humans who had been told since birth that the world was theirs.

They were not sleeping together.

She'd said not yet on the first night and not yet had held. It held the way a decision holds when the person making it has earned it — not with white knuckles, not with the desperate grip of someone holding a door against a force they're not sure they can resist. It held with the quiet certainty of a girl who had learned, in two separate rooms in two separate years, what happened when her body did or didn't move before her mind.

The yurt. The darkness. Kathleen's breathing changing in the other bed. Sex happening *at* her — aimed at her without touching her — while she lay still and felt something she didn't have a word for.

Stone-HENGE. The studio. The blue light. The being-seen so overwhelming that her body opened before her mind could say *wait.* And then the three words on her phone — *I told Kathleen* — and the floor dropping out. Sex becoming a weapon. Sex becoming the thing that destroyed the most important relationship in her life.

Both times, sex was something that happened to her world. A force that arrived and rearranged everything without asking her permission. She would not let it happen again. Not to her world. Not to her body. Not until the body and the mind were in the same room, making the same decision, at the same time.

Démion waited.

He said he wanted her, regularly, the same way he'd said it the first night — direct, unashamed, the way he said everything. Not as pressure. Not as a question disguised as a statement. Not as a hand on her lower back hoping she'd read the signal. He just said it. *I want you.* The way you'd say *I'm hungry* or *it's hot outside* — a fact about his body, offered without expectation of a particular response.

And she'd say not yet, and he'd say okay, and then they'd watch a movie or he'd go to the gym or they'd eat dinner on her balcony with the bay going dark below them, and the wanting was in the room but it wasn't hiding. It was stated and received and set down. It was the cleanest thing she'd ever experienced with a man — the complete absence of performance, of strategy, of the architecture of approach. Alejandro had built an entire cathedral of wanting and never once opened the door. Démion said *door's right here* and then went back to watching TV.

She never had to redirect him. She never had to open a different door so smoothly he didn't realize the one he wanted was closed. She never had to manage his attention because his attention didn't need managing — it was where it was, openly, and when she said not yet, it moved on to the next thing without resentment or accumulation or the tightening around the mouth that she'd watched happen to Alejandro's face a hundred times. Démion's face didn't tighten. His face did what it always did: expressed what he felt, fully, without translation, and moved on.

The honesty made the waiting clean. The waiting, for the first time in her life, was not suffocating.

---

She learned the rhythms of his world.

Training camp started in late July, but the offseason workouts were already happening — voluntary, except nothing was voluntary when you were the first overall pick and the franchise had built its future around your arm. He was at the facility by 6 AM. He worked out for four hours. He studied film. He came back to her smelling like sweat and turf and the antiseptic tang of a professional training room, and the smelling-like was its own kind of intimacy — the smell of his body after effort, honest and unfiltered, the smell of a man who had done the thing he was built to do and was now standing in her kitchen drinking water from the carton.

He talked about football the way she talked about Sheepey — with the total absorption of someone who was inside the thing, not outside looking at it. He didn't analyze the game the way Alejandro analyzed music — no frameworks, no taxonomies, no careful architecture of understanding. He felt it. He knew what the defense would do before it did it the way she knew what would be funny before it was funny — by instinct, by the body's knowledge, by a process that happened below thought and arrived in the muscles already decided.

She'd watch him talk and see the same thing she'd seen on television, except now it was across her kitchen counter — the aliveness, the certainty, the total presence of a man who existed entirely in his body and his body was a magnificent thing to exist in. He didn't live in his head. He didn't live in his frameworks. He lived in his arms and his legs and his lungs and his back and the particular way his body occupied space, which was completely, without apology, the way Florida's heat occupied air.

She was fascinated by this. The sheer *physicality* of him — not just the beauty, though the beauty was undeniable, was in fact the most undeniable thing about the most undeniable person she'd ever met. But the way the physical was the whole thing. With Alejandro, the body was a vehicle for the mind — he forgot to eat, forgot to stand up straight, lived so far inside his own thoughts that his physical self was an afterthought, a coat hanger for the brain. With Démion, the mind was a vehicle for the body. His intelligence — and he was intelligent, sharply so, in ways that surprised people who looked at the size first and expected the mind to be proportionally simple — served his physical existence. He thought about things because thinking about things made the body perform better. Film study. Nutrition. Sleep optimization. The mind as trainer, the body as athlete. The whole thing pointed in one direction: the field, the game, the physical mastery that the world had been confirming since he was old enough to run.

She didn't compare them. She didn't think *Démion is the opposite of Alejandro* — she didn't think about Alejandro at all, or if she did, the thought was a cloud passing across a sun that was too bright to dim. She was here. In Florida. With a man who said what he wanted and waited when she said not yet and smelled like effort and existed in his body the way she'd always wanted to exist in hers — fully, without apology, without the distance of watching yourself from outside.

She was fully present in her life for the first time, and being present meant not looking back.

Hurricane season.

She'd heard the phrase her whole life — growing up in Pensacola until she was seven, it was background noise, the way earthquake season was background noise in places that had earthquakes. Her parents mentioned it the way they mentioned weather: *hurricane season's coming, better stock up.* Her dad had stories — the ones from Alabama, from the Gulf Coast of his childhood, the hurricanes that had names and histories and the particular Southern mythology of surviving things that tried to kill you and telling the story afterward at a barbecue. Her mom's stories were quieter — the boarding up, the batteries, the way the air changed before a storm, a pressure you could feel in your temples.

But Persephoni had been seven when they'd moved to Oregon, and Oregon didn't have hurricanes. Oregon had rain and then more rain and occasionally the kind of wind that knocked over a garbage can and made the news. Hurricane season had been a phrase from a place she used to live, filed in the same category as *Florida Man* and *palmetto bugs* and *the way the air smells before it rains in the South* — real, but distant, belonging to a version of her life that had ended when her dad got the Intel job.

Now she was back. And hurricane season wasn't a phrase anymore. It was a calendar. It was a map. It was the weather app on her phone suddenly showing her things she'd never had to look at — tropical disturbances, projected paths, the cone of uncertainty (a phrase she loved, the cone of uncertainty, it sounded like something from a medieval romance, a cone you wore at a tournament while a queen dropped her handkerchief into your uncertainty). The Atlantic was warming up. The Gulf was warm already. And somewhere off the coast of Africa, the atmosphere was doing the thing it did every summer — spinning, organizing, building systems that would cross an ocean and arrive at her door.

She found it thrilling. She knew this was probably wrong — probably the response of someone who hadn't lived through a real one, who was still in the tourist phase of natural disaster, the phase where danger is aesthetic because it hasn't hurt you yet. But the thrill was real. After nine months of Beaverton — the slow, grey, sealed-in suffocation of COVID and smoke and ice and the hollowness — the idea of a storm with a name and a personality and a path you could track on a screen was almost exciting. Weather that *did* something. Weather with ambition.

---

Elsa.

The name appeared on the tropical outlook in late June — Tropical Storm Elsa, forming in the Atlantic, the fifth named storm of the season, and Persephoni saw the name and the laughter started in her chest and didn't stop.

*Elsa.*

She was in her condo, on the couch, scrolling the weather updates, and she saw the name and she thought of Arendelle and the ice palace and the gloves coming off and the song — the song that had been in every child's mouth for years, the song you couldn't escape, the song that Disney had weaponized so effectively that an entire generation associated ice and snow and letting go with a blonde cartoon queen in a blue dress — and she started singing.

*Let it go, let it go.*

She couldn't stop. She sang it in the kitchen making coffee. She sang it on the balcony watching the bay. She sang it to Démion on the phone — "Elsa's coming, Démion, the cold never bothered me anyway" — and he laughed, that big free laugh, and said "You're insane" with the admiration of a man who had never met anyone like her, which was how he said most things about her, because he hadn't.

The humor was automatic. It was the Personality's reflex — the same instinct that had created Sheepey, the same gift that turned anything into a bit, the same ability to find the funny in the frightening and make the frightening smaller by naming it. She'd done this her whole life: made characters out of chaos, built comedy over pain. The smoke in Beaverton had been the one thing she couldn't make funny. The hollowness had been the one thing that had no bit. But a hurricane named Elsa? A hurricane named after a Disney princess whose whole deal was that she couldn't control her own power and had to *let it go*?

She was singing it in her sleep.

---

Elsa tracked across the Caribbean and into the Gulf, and Persephoni learned what hurricane prep meant when you weren't seven years old and your parents were handling it.

Water. The first thing everyone said — water. Cases of it, stacked in the closet, because the pipes might go and the water treatment might fail and you needed to be able to drink for three days without relying on infrastructure. Batteries. Flashlights. The good flashlights, the kind you didn't buy at the dollar store, because the power might go out and stay out and you needed to see. A portable phone charger. Canned food she would never eat — tuna, beans, condensed soup — stacked on the counter like a small monument to the possibility that the world might briefly stop working.

She didn't board up her windows. Twenty-third floor, the building was rated for it — the glass was impact-resistant, the structure was built to code, the HOA had sent a calm, slightly condescending email about how the tower was designed to withstand Category 3 winds and residents should *remain calm and avoid unnecessary panic.* She read the email in the voice of a man who had never once been in a hurricane and felt very confident about glass.

Démion's house was on the water. Davis Islands — low, flat, the kind of waterfront that storm surge treated as a suggestion. When the cone of uncertainty pointed at Tampa Bay, the evacuation zones lit up, and his neighborhood was in Zone A. The first to go.

"Come up to my place," she said. "You're at sea level. I'm on twenty-three."

He came. He packed a bag — a small bag, because Démion packed the way he did everything, with the minimum necessary, the confidence of a man who assumed the world would provide whatever he'd forgotten — and he drove across the bridge and he came to her condo and he stood in her living room with his bag on the floor and he looked at her and the looking was the same looking it had always been, the wanting that was in the room but wasn't hiding, and she took his bag and put it in the bedroom where it always went and the storm was coming.

The sky changed first.

Not all at once — gradually, the way a face changes when bad news is arriving but hasn't been spoken yet. The blue bled out of the afternoon and something grey moved in, not rain-grey but a heavy, charged, yellowish grey that Persephoni had never seen in a sky before. The bay below her windows went from blue to steel. The palm trees — she could see them from twenty-three floors, tiny and brave, lining the streets — started moving in a way that wasn't wind. It was the *beginning* of wind. The rehearsal. The suggestion of what was coming.

She stood at the window and sang under her breath. *Let it go, let it go, can't hold it back anymore.*

Démion was on her couch, watching the Weather Channel, because Démion handled everything the way he handled a defense — by studying it, by reading its tendencies, by knowing what it would do before it did it. He'd been watching the cone all week. He knew where Elsa was making landfall. He knew the wind speeds. He knew the storm surge projections for Tampa Bay. He was prepared the way an athlete is prepared — physically, mentally, with the specific calm of someone who had faced larger opponents and not flinched.

"Come here," she said.

He looked up from the screen. She was at the window, the sky behind her doing its slow ugly transformation, and she was backlit by it, and she knew she was backlit by it — she was Persephoni, she was always aware of her light, it was the gift and the curse, the parasocial eye contact that worked in person too. She knew what she looked like standing at that window with the storm behind her.

He got up. He came to her. And when he was there — when the full size of him was next to her, blocking the window, the storm behind both of them now — she put her hands on his chest and felt his heartbeat under her palms, steady and slow, the heart of someone whose resting pulse was probably fifty and whose body was a machine built for situations exactly like this: pressure, stakes, the moment before everything happens.

"Not tonight," she said. Quiet. Looking at him.

He waited. Because that was the word she always said — *not tonight, not yet, soon* — and he was a man who heard it and put it down every time without complaint.

"No," she said. "I mean — not tonight. Not *not tonight.*" She shook her head, almost laughing at herself. "Tonight."

She watched his face. She wanted to see it — the moment he understood, the moment the waiting ended. She'd earned this. Two months of sharing a bed and holding the line, his body next to hers every night, the heat of him, the size of him, and every night choosing *not yet* — letting her mind and her body have the conversation they needed to have, the conversation that had never happened before. Not in the yurt, where her body had frozen. Not in the studio, where her body had opened before her mind could intervene. This time the conversation had happened. This time her mind and her body were in the same room, and they were both saying the same thing, and the thing they were saying was *yes.*

His face did something she'd remember for the rest of her life. Not the smile — though the smile was there, the *I knew this would happen* smile, the one the camera found after every touchdown. Something before the smile. Something underneath it. A stillness. The briefest pause of a man who had wanted something for two months and was receiving it and needed one second — just one — to let the receiving land.

Then his hands were on her waist and his mouth was on her mouth and the storm was outside and she was inside and the window rattled behind them and the rain started — not gently, not gradually, but all at once, the way Florida rain arrived, like someone had turned on a faucet in the sky — and the sound of it against the glass was enormous, percussive, the whole building humming with it, and she was kissing him and the rain was on the windows and his hands were lifting her — actually lifting her, the way he'd lifted her in her imagination a hundred times on that couch in Beaverton, 130 pounds, nothing to him, her feet leaving the floor — and she was in his arms and the storm was here and she had chosen this.

She had chosen this.

Not overwhelm. Not survival. Not the numb participation of a life raft she'd clung to because the alternative was drowning. Not the body moving before the mind, the relief of being seen mistaken for desire, the morning after walking home through smoke knowing she hadn't chosen any of it. This was different. This was her mind and her body arriving at the same place at the same time, saying the same word, and the word was a word she'd never said before — not to Alejandro, not to anyone — and the word was *yes* and she meant it all the way down.

The wind howled against the twenty-third floor and the windows held and the rain was a wall of sound and she was inside it, inside the storm, inside his arms, inside the choice she'd made, and for the first time in her life sex was not a thing that happened to her world. It was a thing she did. With her whole self. With her eyes open.

Outside, Elsa raged. Inside, Persephoni was still.

Afterward.

The storm had passed. Not fully — the rain was still coming, softer now, the tantrum winding down, the wind pulling back like a tide going out. But the worst of it was over. The power had flickered twice and held. The building had creaked in ways she hadn't known buildings could creak, deep structural sounds, the bones of the tower acknowledging the force and choosing to stand.

She was lying in her bed — her bed, in her room, in her condo, on the twenty-third floor of a building she'd chosen — and Démion was beside her, and his breathing was the slow even breathing of a man who was either asleep or about to be, and the rain on the windows was the quiet rain, the after-rain, the rain that came when the storm had said what it needed to say.

She looked at the ceiling. Her ceiling. The light from the city below — because the city still had power, because the storm had passed and the lights had stayed on — made patterns on the white surface, moving patterns, the reflection of water on glass. She watched them move.

She didn't feel different. She'd expected to feel different — had expected the choosing to change something, to mark a before and after, the way the yurt had marked a before and after and Stone-HENGE had marked a before and after. But the choosing hadn't changed anything because the choosing was just her catching up to herself. Her body had known since October. Her mind had needed until July. And now they were in the same place and the being-in-the-same-place didn't feel like an event. It felt like breathing. Like the first breath you take after you've been holding your breath, and the breath isn't remarkable — it's just air, just your lungs doing what lungs do — except you'd been holding for so long that the simplicity of it makes your eyes sting.

She turned her head and looked at him. Démion Reyes. Twenty years old. 6'6". Two hundred and fifty pounds of the most gifted athlete the NFL had ever seen, asleep in her bed, in her condo, his face slack and peaceful and young — he looked so young when he slept, younger than he looked on the field or across a restaurant table or standing in the pickup lane at Tampa International. The face of a boy. The body of something mythological. His arm was across her stomach, heavy and warm, and the weight of it was not a trap. It was just weight. Just his arm. Just the physical fact of a man who wanted her and said so and waited when she said not yet and was here because she'd said yes.

The rain kept falling. The city lights kept moving on her ceiling. Somewhere below, the bay was churning with what Elsa had left behind — the agitated water, the debris, the particular mess a storm makes when it passes through a place and leaves it standing.

She was standing.

She closed her eyes and the closing was easy and the ease was not a story she was telling herself. It was just the end of a day in which a storm had come and she had let someone in and the building had held and the lights had stayed on and she was here, in the room she owned, in the life she was building, and the air moved through the vents and the air was just air and outside the window Florida was already starting to forget about Elsa.

Persephoni wouldn't forget. But she wouldn't make it into a story either. Some things just happened. Some things you just chose.

She fell asleep to the sound of rain on glass, twenty-three floors above a bay that was learning her name.

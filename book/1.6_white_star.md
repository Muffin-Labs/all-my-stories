The girls were walking ahead of him.

Kathleen and Persephone, hand in hand, moving through the last rooms of the castle at a pace that didn't include him. He could see their shapes ahead — Kathleen small, Persephone tall, their joined hands swinging slightly between them — and behind them, behind everything, Sergey followed with his bag on his shoulder and his notebook inside it and nothing to write.

The princess riff was still in him. Not the content — he couldn't have recited it, couldn't have reconstructed the sequence of events she'd narrated, the exact words — but the shape of it, the thing it had done, the way it had moved through him like a frequency that wasn't sound but worked on the same principle: vibration, resonance, the feeling of a tuning fork held to bone. She had taken what happened in the yurt — the thing he'd spent twelve hours trying not to think about, the thing the classification system had encountered and failed to file — and she had turned it into a story about a princess and a poet and a village girl and she had told it on a staircase with the British accent she used for Sheepey, and it had been the most precise and devastating act of communication he'd ever witnessed.

He kept trying to take it apart. That was the problem — that was always the problem. She had built something and his brain wanted to disassemble it, wanted to find the mechanism, the gears, the engineering. How had she done it? She'd mapped the three of them onto medieval characters. She'd used the staircase — descending, each turn revealing a new element, the narrow windows strobing light across her as she walked — as a delivery system. She'd built the fiction carefully, so that by the time it cracked open on the word *you* the listener had already accepted the framework and couldn't escape it. It was — he reached for the word — architecturally sound. She'd constructed a siege engine disguised as a fairy tale and wheeled it through the gate while they were still smiling.

And he had nothing. He had stood in the courtyard with his jaw locked and his hand in Kathleen's and he had nothing to say. Not because the words were wrong — that had happened before, the words dissolving on contact with experience — but because the system itself had been outperformed. She'd used his instrument. Story, metaphor, the arrangement of meaning into structure. That was supposed to be his territory. The notebooks full of attempted metaphors, the songs that almost got there, the frameworks he built around feelings so that feelings could be examined safely from the outside. And she'd done it in thirty seconds on a staircase without notes.

Spontaneous mythopoesis. He'd thought the phrase in a bookshop yesterday, watching her build a muffin's biography. It had been admiring then. Now it was something else. Now it was evidence that the thing he did — the careful, taxonomic, effortful version of turning experience into structure — was the lesser mode. She didn't build structures around feelings. She built feelings out of structures. The fairy tale wasn't a container for the truth. It was the truth, arriving in the only form that could carry it. Sometimes the most precise thing you can say is a fiction.

He followed the girls through the gatehouse. Arrow loops and murder holes overhead — he registered this automatically, the brain still cataloging even when the catalog served no purpose. Ahead of him, Persephone was saying something about Normans. Something about cooking. Kathleen laughed — a small laugh, tentative, testing whether laughing was allowed — and then Persephone said something else and the laugh came back bigger and Sergey watched it happen from twenty feet behind them, the way you watch a fire being rebuilt from embers, someone blowing carefully on something almost dead.

She was fixing it. Right now, in real time, she was repairing the thing she'd broken — or the thing he'd broken, or the thing they'd all broken — and she was doing it with the same tool she'd used to break it: story. Normans who couldn't cook. A castle cat that got boiled. She was laying comedy over the wound the way you lay gauze over a burn, quickly and gently and with what looked like the confidence of someone who had done this before, who knew exactly how much pressure the injury could take.

He couldn't do this. He could name what she was doing — narrative repair, social reweaving, the deployment of humor as connective tissue — and the naming was useless. Naming was always useless. He could name everything about Persephone and understand nothing. He could classify every gesture, every vocal inflection, every instance of spontaneous mythopoesis in his mental ledger, and the ledger would be full and the understanding would be empty. The Emissary could describe the kingdom to the last brick. It still couldn't run it.

Behind him, the castle receded. Stone and sky and the wind through roofless rooms, and ahead of him the girls walking, and between them and him a distance that was not twenty feet but something else entirely — a distance measured not in space but in capacity, in the gap between what he could analyze and what she could do.

George found the car the way George always found things: by deciding where it was and walking there with the confidence of a man who had never been wrong about anything, or who had been wrong so often that the distinction between right and wrong had ceased to matter. Rosemary was beside him, her phone out, taking one last photo of the castle from the parking lot — the whole thing framed against the sky, pale stone and dark cloud, the kind of photograph that would look beautiful and tell you nothing about what had happened inside those walls.

The car arranged itself the way cars do when something has shifted and nobody's acknowledged the shift. George driving. Rosemary navigating with the brochure she'd picked up at the pub — Southampton, the docks, history — and reading from it with the same enthusiasm she brought to everything George handed her, which always seemed total and immediate: "It says the medieval walls are still standing, George! You can walk on them!"

The back seat. Kathleen in the middle. But leaning left — toward Persephone, not toward him. Their hands were still joined, resting on Kathleen's knee, the fingers interlaced in the easy way of two people who'd been holding hands since childhood. Kathleen's other hand was in her own lap. Not reaching for him. Not finding his knee or his arm or any of the points of contact she'd been claiming all morning, the touches he'd cataloged as *post-coital territoriality* and which now, in the rearranged geometry of the back seat, had simply stopped.

Sergey was on the right. Against the window. The same position he'd been in on the drive to Hay-on-Wye, except that on that drive he'd been inside the triangle — Kathleen's hand in his, Persephone's voice filling the car, the three of them a shape with three sides. Now the shape had two sides and a point floating somewhere off the edge. He could feel the geometry. He always felt geometry.

Persephone was being normal.

She was commenting on the countryside — the green hills giving way to flatter land as they headed east, the stone walls replaced by hedgerows, a field of sheep that she narrated for Rosemary's benefit: "Those are Sheepey's cousins. The Gloucestershire branch. Very distinguished. They don't mix with the Welsh sheep — it's a class thing." Her voice was warm and bright and aimed at the front seat, or at Kathleen, or at the car in general, or at everyone except him. She wasn't freezing him out. That was the precision of it. She wasn't ignoring him or punishing him or giving him the silent treatment. She was simply flowing around him, the way water flows around a stone in a stream — not hostile to the stone, not even aware of the stone as an obstacle, just moving in the direction it was already going and the stone was not in that direction.

He noticed everything. The angle of Kathleen's body away from him. The way Persephone's commentary included George ("Dad would have loved the castle, if he'd gone") in a way that was either innocent or pointed and he couldn't tell which. The fact that Kathleen was quieter than usual — not silent, not withdrawn, but dampened, like a bell wrapped in cloth. She laughed at the Sheepey bits but the laughs were careful. She looked like a girl performing not-being-shaken. She was doing it well. But her hand stayed in Persephone's and didn't reach for his and the not-reaching was its own sentence in a language he was only just learning to read.

George mentioned the Titanic.

Of course he did. George was talking about Southampton — the docks, the harbor, the history of the port — and the Titanic came up the way everything came up with George, casually, generously, a gift of information offered to the car with no particular agenda. "Sailed from Southampton, you know. Biggest ship in the world. My grandmother used to say her grandmother saw it leave. Could be true. Could be one of her stories." He laughed. Rosemary laughed. The car absorbed the information and moved on.

Sergey didn't move on. The Titanic stayed. It lodged in the classification system — the system that was limping, rebooting, trying to reassemble itself after the princess had walked through it — and it sat there like a piece of furniture he hadn't asked for. The Titanic. The unsinkable ship. The magnificent structure built with total engineering confidence, every rivet placed with certainty, and the ocean hadn't read the plans. The ice was there and the structure wasn't enough and the water got in through the place where the structure met the thing it couldn't account for.

He caught himself. He caught himself reaching for the metaphor — the Titanic, the triangle, the structural failure — and heard it the way she would hear it. *Too much, Sergey.* The Emissary with its symbols. The poet who wrote an entire ode to a particular quality of light observed on a Tuesday. She'd said that on the staircase. She'd described him and he'd recognized himself and the recognition had been a door opening onto a room he didn't want to enter.

He looked out the window. The English countryside was doing what the English countryside always did — being green and old and indifferent to the people passing through it. Stone walls. Hedgerows. Sheep who didn't know they were Sheepey's cousins and wouldn't have cared. He pressed his forehead against the glass and the glass was cool and the cool felt good and he stayed there, watching the country pass, not writing, not classifying, not reaching for anything, just being the stone the water flowed around.

The White Star Tavern was on Oxford Street in Southampton — a Victorian building with dark wood and warm light and the kind of confident aging that meant someone had been taking care of it for a long time. It was, Sergey thought, the architectural equivalent of George: handsome, established, taking up exactly the right amount of space, making everyone around it feel like they were in the right place.

George handled the check-in. One room — they were a family, traveling together, the kids were fine sharing. Rosemary stood beside him at the reception desk with a posture that said she knew her role in this scene: stand here, look pleasant, let the big man handle the logistics. She was good at the role. She'd been good at it for as long as Sergey had known her.

Two queen beds and a couch.

Nobody discussed the arrangement. George and Rosemary took the bed closer to the door — the protector's position, the bed that said *we're between you and whatever might come in.* Kathleen and Persephone took the bed by the window. They'd been together all afternoon — the hand-holding at the castle carrying forward into the car, into the tavern, into the room. They put their bags on the bed and Kathleen sat on the edge and looked at the room and Persephone sat beside her and they had the air of two people who had been through something and were choosing to be next to each other on the other side of it.

Sergey took the couch.

It was under the window, pushed against the wall, narrow and firm. A piece of furniture designed for sitting during the day and not designed for much else. He put his bag at one end and sat on it and the couch had the exact right quality of wrongness — not uncomfortable enough to complain about, not comfortable enough to feel like you belonged there. A margin. A remainder. In the yurt there had been two beds and a gap between them — the charged six-foot space where everything had happened. Here there were two beds and a couch, and the couch wasn't in the gap. The couch was outside the geometry entirely. The beds were where the couples were. The couch was where you put the boy who didn't belong to anyone.

He took out his phone. He disappeared into it the way he disappeared into information when his body had nowhere to go — reading articles, checking nothing, scrolling through feeds he didn't care about. The screen was a small blue light in his hands and it illuminated nothing and that was the point.

---

Dinner was downstairs.

George had found the restaurant in the tavern the way he found everything — by walking in a direction and discovering that the thing he wanted was exactly where he expected it to be. The room was warm and dark-paneled and full of the particular kind of English pub noise that sounded like a fireplace even when there wasn't one. George ordered for the table — not rudely, not imperiously, just with the easy assumption that he knew what everyone wanted, which he mostly did, because George seemed to know what everyone wanted before they said it. He ordered Sergey the fish. Sergey didn't like fish. He ate the fish without mentioning this, because mentioning it would have required a kind of assertion the evening didn't seem to have room for.

Rosemary was radiant. She always was at dinner. Something about having George's attention in a public setting — the arm around her shoulder when they'd walked in, the way he'd pulled out her chair, the "beautiful, baby" when she came back from the bathroom in the dress she'd been saving for their last night. She glowed under it. She organized herself around his attention the way flowers organize around light — not choosing to, just doing it, the phototropism of a woman whose entire architecture seemed built around being seen by this man.

Sergey watched George narrate the trip.

It was remarkable. George was building the vacation in real time — assembling the version that would become the memory, the official record, the story they'd tell people when they got home. "The festival was incredible. The kids were in heaven. You should've seen Persephone at the castle — she was giving us the history, the whole thing, like a tour guide." He beamed at Persephone across the table. Persephone smiled back — a real smile, or a smile real enough to pass — and said nothing about princesses.

"And Rosemary loved Chepstow," George continued. "The views, baby. Remember the views?"

Rosemary nodded. "The views were something else," she said.

Sergey watched this. Rosemary had not gone to the castle. Rosemary had gone to the pub across the road from the castle. She had not seen the views. She had not walked the walls or climbed the tower or stood in the wind above the River Wye. But George was including her in the memory — he was writing her into the castle the way a novelist writes a character into a scene — and she was accepting it, nodding, smiling, adjusting her own memory to accommodate the version he was building. *The views were something else.* As if she'd seen them. As if they were hers.

He could classify this. He had the framework — the loud story drowning out the quiet one, the version that felt right replacing the version that was true. Sergey didn't think George was lying. He didn't think George was deliberately rewriting anything. George was just doing what the Personality does when it's in charge: telling the story that feels right, the story where everyone was happy and everything was beautiful and his wife was beside him at the castle taking in the views. The truth — that Rosemary had been at the pub, that she'd looked at the castle the way someone looks at a thing they want, and then folded whatever she was feeling into George's plan without a word — wasn't being suppressed. It just wasn't part of the story George was telling. And in the absence of a competing narrative, George's version became the only version, and Rosemary's experience disappeared into it like a stream disappearing into a river.

Sergey saw all of this. He classified it with the precision of a boy who had read McGilchrist twice and could identify the exact mechanism by which one person's story overwrites another's. He felt a quiet satisfaction in the seeing — the framework worked, the pattern was clear. He watched George build the version and Rosemary accept it and he understood exactly what was happening and the understanding felt like solid ground.

He turned back to his food. He thought about dessert.

Across the table, Kathleen was cutting her chicken into small, precise, even pieces. He filed this without thinking: *coping mechanism, fine motor control as emotional regulation.* The label arrived and he accepted it and moved on, the same way George had moved on from Rosemary's castle, the same way a story overwrites the thing it describes — except Sergey didn't see this. He saw George doing it. He didn't see himself.

Kathleen was quiet.

She ate her food. She laughed at George's jokes — the right laughs, at the right moments, the performance of a girl who was fine. She was sitting next to Persephone again. Not next to Sergey. Across the table from him, not beside him, and the table between them felt like more than wood and cutlery. She was fine. She was being so fine that the fineness was a wall, smooth and unscalable, and behind it — he didn't know. He realized he didn't know what was behind Kathleen's walls. He'd been classifying her for two years — her body, her laugh, her doe eyes, her warmth — and he'd never once asked what the classification was missing. She was the data set he'd never questioned. The drawer he'd never opened from the other side.

She looked up and caught him watching her. Her big round eyes met his across the table and held, and for a moment he saw something in them he couldn't classify — not anger, not sadness, not the blotchy hurt from the courtyard. Something quieter. Something that looked like a question she'd been carrying for a long time and had only just realized she could ask. Then George said something and the moment broke and she looked away and the question went back behind the wall.

The room at night.

Lights out. George's snoring began almost immediately — the deep, rhythmic, industrial sound of a large man who slept the way he did everything else: fully, without apology, taking up all available space including the acoustic kind. Rosemary's breathing was softer, already shaped around his rhythm. A compass needle that had found its north.

From the other bed: the girls. Quiet. Kathleen's breathing and Persephone's breathing, close together, the way they'd breathed in the yurt before everything — except this time they were the only people in the bed and the gap between the beds contained nothing but carpet and a couch with a boy on it who used to be part of the geometry and was now a footnote.

The ceiling was flat and white and told him nothing.

In the yurt there had been the crown — the wooden ring, the support poles converging, the gap between the cone and the ring where the sky came through, where the moon had come through, where two kinds of light had fallen into the space and divided it. Structure. Meaning. Something to read. Here there was plaster. A smooth, unbroken surface eight feet above him that had no opening, no convergence, no symbol. Just a ceiling. He looked up and found nothing to read and the nothing was worse than the something, because at least in the yurt the agony had architecture.

The light through the window was amber. Streetlight — steady, industrial, the city's version of illumination. Not the stove's orange flicker. Not the moon's silver-blue. A third light that belonged to no framework, that didn't organize itself around his categories, that didn't care what he called it. Cars passed on the street below. Voices, faint. The sound of a city that was doing what cities do at night — existing, ongoing, indifferent to the boy on the couch who was trying to find meaning in its light and finding only light.

He thought about the princess.

He replayed it — not the words this time but the architecture. The staircase. The spiral descent. The way she'd kept her back to them so they couldn't see her face. The way she'd used the narrow windows — bright, dark, bright, dark — to time the revelations, each new element of the story arriving in the light and landing in the dark. She hadn't planned it. He was almost certain she hadn't planned it. She'd started with "There was a princess who lived here" the way she started everything — casually, as if the story was already there and she was just noticing it — and the castle had given her the rest. The staircase became the delivery system. The windows became the rhythm. The courtyard became the stage. She'd used the building the way a musician uses a room — not imposing structure on it but finding the structure that was already there and playing into it.

He couldn't do this. He could analyze it. He could identify every element — the mapping of characters, the escalating specificity, the moment the fiction cracked on *you* — but identifying the elements was like identifying the notes in a chord without hearing the chord. He had the components and she had the music and the distance between components and music was the distance between his notebook and her voice on a staircase.

The princess wasn't jealous.

This was the thing he kept arriving at, the piece of data that the system couldn't reclassify no matter how many times he ran it through. The princess was angry. The princess was hurt. But the princess was not jealous of the village girl. The princess didn't want the poet. The princess wanted the triangle — the thing they'd had, the three of them, before the poet closed his eyes and ruined it. The princess had protected the village girl. She'd lain still all night in the dark to keep her friend from shame. If the princess had wanted the poet, she wouldn't have protected the girl's moment. She'd have disrupted it. The stillness was the proof. The not-moving was the evidence. Persephone had lain there awake and heard everything and her instinct had been to protect Kathleen, not to claim him.

Which meant.

He lay on the couch in the amber light and let it arrive.

She didn't want him.

Not the way he wanted her. Not the involuntary pull, the drawer that wouldn't close, the face behind his eyelids. She had heard the yurt and felt — what? Loss. Grief for the triangle. Anger at the carelessness. But not desire. The princess's fury was the fury of someone whose family had been reckless, not the fury of someone whose beloved had chosen wrong. She loved them both and they'd been careless with the thing she loved and that was all. That was everything and it was all.

He'd been imagining her awake and wanting. That was the fantasy that had moved through him in the yurt — the idea of her there, listening, aware, the charge of her attention adding something to the moment that the moment didn't deserve. The reality was different and worse. She was awake and grieving. Not for him. For what they'd all had. For Sheepey in the car and Muffin in the bookshop and the sound of Kathleen laughing so hard she stopped walking. For the thing his closed eyes had broken.

He turned on the couch. The cushions were too short for his body — his feet hung off one end or his head pressed against the armrest, and every position was a minor negotiation with furniture that hadn't been designed for sleeping. He thought about the White Star Line. He thought about the Titanic sailing from this city, from docks he could probably see from the window if he stood up and looked. The unsinkable ship. He caught himself reaching for it — the metaphor, the structural parallel, the classification — and let it go. Not because it wasn't apt but because the reaching was the problem. The Emissary, even now, even here, on a couch in the dark in a room where the girl he wanted didn't want him and the girl who wanted him was holding someone else — even now his brain was reaching for a framework. Reaching for something to put between himself and the feeling. A symbol. A category. A name.

What was the feeling?

He lay still. He tried not to reach. He tried to let it arrive the way she would let it arrive — not grasping, not classifying, just opening his hands and seeing what settled into them.

Loneliness.

That was it. That was the unclassifiable thing that turned out, when he stopped classifying, to be the most ordinary thing in the world. He was lonely. He was in a room with five people and he was on a couch by himself and Kathleen was in a bed with Persephone and his girlfriend was holding her best friend's hand instead of his and he deserved this — he knew he deserved this, the way you know something structural, something architectural, something built into the foundation — and knowing he deserved it didn't make the couch any wider or the ceiling any lower or the night any shorter.

He was fifteen years old and he was lonely and the loneliness had a weight that no framework could hold.

From somewhere below — the tavern, a radio, someone's phone — a guitar line drifted up through the floor. He couldn't place the song. His brain didn't try. It just held the sound the way it had held the loneliness — openly, without reaching — and somewhere in the holding, a word arrived. Not a classification. A beginning. *Careless.* Her word. Except now it sounded different. Now it sounded like the first line of something he hadn't written yet.

---

He didn't sleep well.

He slept in pieces — fragments of unconsciousness interrupted by the sounds of a room with five people in it. George's snoring, constant as weather. A toilet flushing. Someone getting water. At one point Kathleen said something in her sleep — a word he couldn't make out, soft and blurred — and he lay there in the dark and wondered if it was his name and knew it didn't matter whether it was.

Morning came through the window as grey English light, the kind that didn't commit to anything — not bright, not dark, just there, like the weather had opinions but was keeping them to itself. He'd slept wrong. His neck hurt. His back had the specific ache of a body that had spent eight hours negotiating with a couch. He sat up and the room was already moving — George in the bathroom, Rosemary packing with the efficient bustle of a woman who'd been organizing departures her whole life. Kathleen was still in bed, the comforter pulled up, her eyes open, watching the ceiling.

Persephone was in the bathroom when George came out. She was quick. She always moved through rooms as though she already knew where everything was and had decided not to waste time confirming it.

The packing. The checkout. George carried the bags because George carried everything. The morning had the compressed, slightly frantic energy of departure — the vacation contracting, the hotel room returning to its anonymous state, the personal effects being gathered and stuffed into bags as if the evidence of having been here was something that needed to be erased.

---

George drove to Heathrow.

An hour and a half on the M3. The car was quieter than it had been all trip — not tense, not angry, just tired. The vacation was winding down the way vacations do, the return pulling everyone forward into the version of themselves they'd be when they got home. George was probably thinking about work. Rosemary was probably thinking about the house. Kathleen was in the middle of the back seat, between him and Persephone, and she'd put her earbuds in — one of them, the left one, the one closest to Persephone — and she was listening to something and staring at her phone and she had the particular inwardness of a person who was choosing not to be present.

Persephone slept. Or performed sleep. Her head was against the window, her curls falling across her face, her eyes closed, and she looked like someone who had decided to be done with this part — done with England, done with the car, done with the negotiation of who was sitting where and who was touching whom and what the silences meant. She seemed ahead of all of them. Already somewhere else. And even asleep — or pretending — she was the thing the car organized itself around. Everyone else was arranged in relation to her. George's stories seemed aimed at making her laugh. Rosemary's enthusiasm seemed calibrated to match hers. Kathleen's hand was resting on her own knee, open, palm up, as if waiting for Persephone's hand to find it. Even unconscious, even absent, she was the center.

The English countryside slid past the window. Green fields. Motorway. Service stations that looked the same as every other service station in every other country. The trip was ending. England was becoming a place they had been, not a place they were, and the distance between those two things was already being narrated — by George, who was telling Rosemary about a pub he'd liked and a castle he remembered and a festival that had been "absolutely world-class, baby, we should do this every year." The memory was being built while the experience was still warm. George was already at work — selecting, arranging, building the version that would be remembered, which was already different from the version that had happened.

Sergey watched the countryside and didn't contribute. He let George's narration wash over him the way he let everything wash over him — passively, receiving, the stone in the stream. He thought about how George's version of the trip didn't include the yurt. Not the real yurt — not the two lights, not the gap between the beds, not the sounds, not the princess, not the courtyard. George's version had the festival and the castle and the pub and the beautiful countryside and his beautiful wife and the kids having a great time. That version would become the photograph. The refrigerator magnet. The story at dinner parties. And the rest — the real rest, the part that actually happened — would have no version at all, because none of them would tell it.

---

Heathrow.

The terminal was enormous and bright and full of people going places, which was the least helpful observation Sergey had ever made and he was aware of this, which was the second least helpful observation. His brain was performing at reduced capacity. The system was running but the outputs were flat — descriptions without analysis, observations without classification. He saw things and didn't file them. He noticed things and didn't name them. The airport moved around him and he moved through it and the only thing his brain produced with any conviction was: *the drawer is broken and you don't have a new one.*

Check-in. Security. The ritual of returning — passports and boarding passes and the slow shuffle through the line and the removal of shoes and belts and the passage through a machine that saw through you and found nothing worth stopping.

They found the gate. George settled into a chair with the expansive comfort of a man who had mastered the art of being at ease in public spaces. Rosemary beside him, already on her phone, probably texting Dana and Jenny, probably telling a version of the trip that had been filtered through George's version. Kathleen sat across from them, earbuds in, legs tucked under her, looking at something on her phone with the careful attention of someone who didn't want to look at anything else.

Persephone sat next to Kathleen. Their shoulders touched. They didn't talk. They didn't need to. The patch from the castle was holding — the comedy about Normans, the hand-holding through the ruins, the laugh that had rebuilt something. Whatever Persephone had broken with the princess riff, she'd repaired enough with the boiled-cat bit to get them here, to this gate, shoulders touching, in a silence that was companionable instead of devastated.

Sergey sat one seat away from the group. Not far. Not dramatically separate. Just — one seat. The distance was small enough to be accidental and he knew it wasn't and they probably knew it wasn't and nobody mentioned it.

He took out his notebook.

It had been in his bag since the castle. He hadn't opened it since — when? The morning of the festival? Two days ago? It felt longer. It felt like the notebook belonged to a version of himself that had existed before the staircase, before the word *you* cracked the fiction open, before the princess told him what he was.

He opened it. The last thing he'd written was from the McGilchrist talk — notes on the left-brain/right-brain discussion, fragments of the metaphor he'd been building, the king and the servant, the master and the emissary. His handwriting was neat and small and organized. It looked like the handwriting of someone who believed that if you arranged the words carefully enough, they would become true.

He turned to a blank page.

He tried to write the yurt.

Not the events — he couldn't write the events, not here, not at a gate surrounded by people, not with Kathleen one seat away. He tried to write the feeling. The two lights. The crown above him with its ring of sky. The way the stove had ticked and the wind had moved through the canvas walls and somewhere a guitar had played something he almost recognized. He tried to get the moment before everything — the three of them in the yurt, Persephone's voice doing Sheepey, Kathleen's laugh winding down, the warmth and the dark and the sense that something was about to happen that hadn't happened yet. The last good moment. The moment before the drawer broke.

He wrote and crossed out and wrote again. The words were wrong. They were always wrong — that wasn't new — but now they were wrong in a way he could identify: they were too careful. Too arranged. He was building a framework around the feeling and the framework was killing the feeling. He was doing what the princess had shown him he always did — constructing a siege engine when what was needed was a voice on a staircase. His metaphors were dead. His structures were dead. His notebooks were full of dead structures that organized truth without ever making it live.

He stared at the page. A few lines. Crossed out. Rewritten. Crossed out again. The gap between what had happened and what he could say about what had happened was the gap between the castle and the couch, between the princess's story and his notebook, between her and him. And the gap was the whole problem. And the gap was the whole book he'd someday write, except he wouldn't write it, because the writing was the gap — the act of translating experience into words was itself the distance, the tax of translating, the cost of turning feeling into words.

Kathleen got up and moved to the seat beside him.

She always did this — found her way to his shoulder when he was writing, her chin on his arm or her head tilted toward his page, reading as he worked. She loved watching him write. She'd told him once that it was her favorite thing about him — not the songs, not the performing, but the writing, the private act of a boy putting words on a page with his hand, and the way his face changed when he did it. She'd said this and he'd filed it and it had gone into the classification system under *Kathleen: positive reinforcement, creative process* and he hadn't thought about it again until right now, right here, at the gate, when she leaned over and read the crossed-out lines about the yurt and she didn't know they were about the yurt.

She didn't know they were about the yurt. She read the lines about the two lights and the wind through canvas and the crown above and the moment before everything changed, and she read them as a poem, or the beginning of a poem, or the beginning of a song — because that's what his notebook contained, as far as she knew. Songs. Lyrics. Beautiful attempts at beautiful things. If she'd heard her own feet on the fur rug in those lines, her own name in that voice, her face would have shown it. Her face showed nothing. She was reading a poem.

"That's beautiful, babe," she said.

She meant it. She always sounded like she meant it. She leaned her head on his shoulder and her hair smelled like the hotel shampoo — something floral, something institutional, not the lavender he associated with her — and she was warm against him and she was his girlfriend and she thought he was writing something beautiful and she was right, it was beautiful, and the beauty was a lie, and the lie was the whole problem with everything.

He let her rest her head on his shoulder. He didn't move. He didn't write. He sat there with the notebook open and the crossed-out lines visible and Kathleen's warmth against his arm and the gate full of people waiting to go home and England outside the windows — grey and green and done with them.

The gate attendant called their flight.

Sergey closed the notebook. He put it in his bag. He stood up and Kathleen stood up beside him and the movement was ordinary and coordinated and it felt like the last frame of something, the final image before the scene ended and the next one hadn't started yet.

They boarded the plane. England became a country they'd visited. The festival, the castle, the yurt, the couch, the pub, the princess, the muffin, the two lights — all of it receding, becoming memory, becoming the version that would be told. George would tell his version. Rosemary would live inside it. Kathleen would tell hers — the version where, he supposed, her boyfriend loved her and the festival was magical and the yurt was the best night of her life.

And Sergey would have his notebook. His crossed-out lines. His precious failures and his amateur cartography. Maps of a territory he'd walked through and couldn't draw. Songs about something he'd felt and couldn't name. The whole collection of wrong words for the right things, carried home in a bag on a plane above an ocean, and none of them — not one — good enough to make the stone hear it.
